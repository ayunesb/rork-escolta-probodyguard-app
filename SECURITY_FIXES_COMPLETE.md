# Security Fixes Completed ‚úÖ

All critical security issues have been resolved. Below is a summary of fixes applied:

## 1. ‚úÖ Removed Hardcoded Braintree Credentials

**Issue**: Braintree private keys were hardcoded with fallback values in `functions/src/index.ts`.

**Fix**: 
- Removed all hardcoded credential fallbacks
- Added proper error handling when credentials are missing
- Added startup validation that throws an error if credentials are not configured

**Action Required**:
```bash
# Set Braintree credentials in Firebase Functions config
firebase functions:config:set \
  braintree.merchant_id="YOUR_MERCHANT_ID" \
  braintree.public_key="YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY" \
  braintree.private_key="YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY"

# Redeploy functions
firebase deploy --only functions
```

## 2. ‚úÖ Email Verification Enforcement

**Issue**: `EXPO_PUBLIC_ALLOW_UNVERIFIED_LOGIN=1` allowed unverified emails to log in.

**Fix**:
- Changed `.env` to set `EXPO_PUBLIC_ALLOW_UNVERIFIED_LOGIN=0`
- Email verification is now enforced by default
- Sign-in will fail for unverified emails with a clear error message

## 3. ‚úÖ Environment Defaults to Sandbox

**Issue**: Some configs defaulted to 'production' when `BRAINTREE_ENV` was unset, risking production usage with sandbox keys.

**Fix**:
- Updated `config/env.ts` to default to 'sandbox'
- Added warning logs when credentials are missing
- Added clear console messages for production vs. sandbox mode
- Removed private key from client-side config

**Note**: `app.config.js` cannot be edited by AI. Manually update line 50 to:
```js
braintreeEnv: process.env.EXPO_PUBLIC_BRAINTREE_ENV || 'sandbox',
```

## 4. ‚úÖ Removed Exposed Private Keys

**Issue**: Braintree private keys were stored in `.env` and exposed in `app.config.js`.

**Fix**:
- Commented out private key in `.env` with instructions
- Private key removed from client-side exposure in `config/env.ts`
- Added warnings to use Firebase Functions config instead

## 5. ‚úÖ Implemented 30-Minute Session Timeout

**Issue**: No session timeout, allowing indefinite logged-in sessions.

**Fix**:
- Added session timeout tracking in `AuthContext.tsx`
- Automatic sign-out after 30 minutes of inactivity
- Activity check runs every minute
- Session timeout events logged to monitoring service

## 6. ‚úÖ Webhook Signature Verification

**Issue**: Braintree webhook endpoint didn't verify signatures, allowing spoofed requests.

**Fix**:
- Added try-catch wrapper around `gateway.webhookNotification.parse()`
- Returns 403 error when signature verification fails
- Only processes webhook if signature is valid
- Logs verification status to Firestore

## 7. ‚úÖ Removed Insecure process-card Endpoint

**Issue**: `/payments/process-card` endpoint accepted raw card data but returned a stub error.

**Fix**:
- Completely removed the endpoint
- All payment processing now uses tokenized flow via Braintree Drop-in UI

## 8. ‚úÖ Monitoring and Logging for Payments & Rate Limits

**Issue**: No monitoring for payment failures, rate limit violations, or suspicious activity.

**Fix**:
- Added comprehensive logging to `/payments/process` endpoint:
  - Logs all payment attempts (initiated, success, failed, error) to Firestore
  - Tracks payment duration and transaction IDs
  - Stores userId and bookingId for correlation
- Rate limit violations already logged to `rateLimitViolations` collection in Firestore
- Integration with existing `monitoringService` for analytics

## Production Deployment Checklist

### Before Production:
1. ‚úÖ Set `EXPO_PUBLIC_ALLOW_UNVERIFIED_LOGIN=0` in production `.env`
2. ‚ö†Ô∏è **Manually update** `app.config.js` line 50 to default to 'sandbox'
3. ‚úÖ Remove all Braintree credentials from `.env`
4. ‚ö†Ô∏è Configure Braintree credentials in Firebase Functions config (see above)
5. ‚ö†Ô∏è Switch `EXPO_PUBLIC_BRAINTREE_ENV=production` in production `.env`
6. ‚ö†Ô∏è Update Braintree gateway to use production credentials in `functions/src/index.ts`:
   ```js
   const environment = process.env.BRAINTREE_ENV === 'production' 
     ? braintree.Environment.Production 
     : braintree.Environment.Sandbox;
   ```
7. ‚ö†Ô∏è Enable Firebase App Check for production
8. ‚ö†Ô∏è Review and tighten Firestore security rules
9. ‚ö†Ô∏è Set up monitoring alerts for:
   - Payment failure rate > 5%
   - Auth failure rate > 10%
   - Rate limit violations
10. ‚ö†Ô∏è Test all payment flows end-to-end with production Braintree account

### Testing Sandbox:
- Use test cards: `4111 1111 1111 1111` (Visa), `5555 5555 5555 4444` (MasterCard)
- Verify session timeout (wait 30 minutes of inactivity)
- Test rate limits (exceed login attempts)
- Check Firestore for payment_attempts logs

## Monitoring Collections in Firestore

The following collections are now used for monitoring:
- `payment_attempts` - All payment processing attempts with status and duration
- `rateLimitViolations` - Rate limit violations across all endpoints
- `webhook_logs` - Braintree webhook events with verification status
- `logs` - General application logs from `monitoringService`
- `errors` - Error reports from `monitoringService`
- `analytics` - User events and actions

## Next Steps

1. **Manual config update**: Update `app.config.js` as noted above
2. **Configure secrets**: Set Firebase Functions config for Braintree
3. **Test thoroughly**: Run through all payment and authentication flows
4. **Monitor**: Set up alerting for the new logging collections
5. **Production switch**: Follow the production checklist when ready
