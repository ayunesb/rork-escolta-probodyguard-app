# üöÄ Quick Fix: App Connection Issue

### Option 1: Use Web Browser (Fastest!)
Press `w` in the terminal where Expo is running to open the app in your web browser.

1. **Make sure both devices are on same WiFi**
   - Mac and iPhone must be on the same network
   - Check WiFi settings on both devices
