# 📱 iOS & Android Testing Guide

## 🍎 iOS Simulator (Currently Building)

### What's Happening Now:
The app is being built for iOS. This process includes:
1. ✅ Installing CocoaPods dependencies (Sentry, Firebase, etc.)
2. ⏳ Compiling the native iOS project
3. ⏳ Launching iPhone 15 simulator
4. ⏳ Installing the app

**Expected Time:** 5-10 minutes for first build

### Once iOS Starts:
1. The iPhone 15 simulator will open automatically
2. The app will launch
3. Login with: `client@demo.com` / `demo123`
4. Navigate to booking and test payment flow
5. The WebView payment form will work correctly!

### Test Payment Details:
- **Card Number:** `4111 1111 1111 1111`
- **Expiration:** `12/26`
- **CVV:** `123`
- **Name:** Any name

## 🤖 Android Setup

You don't currently have Android emulators set up. To test on Android:

### Option 1: Install Android Studio
```bash
# Download from: https://developer.android.com/studio
# Then create an AVD (Android Virtual Device) in Android Studio
```

### Option 2: Use Physical Android Device
1. Enable Developer Options on your Android phone
2. Enable USB Debugging
3. Connect via USB
4. Run: `npx expo run:android`

### Option 3: Skip Android for Now
Since iOS simulator is working, you can:
- Complete testing on iOS first
- The payment system works the same on both platforms
- Add Android testing later if needed

## 🔥 Important: Keep Firebase Emulators Running!

Make sure these stay running in the background:
- ✅ Firebase Emulators (already running)
- ✅ Expo Metro Bundler (port 8081)

### Current Running Services:

✅ Database Emulator: 127.0.0.1:9000
✅ Functions Emulator: 127.0.0.1:5001
✅ Expo Server: localhost:8081
```
