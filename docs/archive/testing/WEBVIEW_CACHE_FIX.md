# 🔄 WebView Cache Fix Applied

## Problem Identified

The WebView was **caching the old HTML** even after Metro reloaded! That's why you're still seeing the old payment form without CVV and ZIP fields.

## ✅ Fix Applied

Added cache-busting properties to the WebView:
```typescript
<WebView
  key={Date.now()}          // ✅ Force new WebView instance each time
  cacheEnabled={false}       // ✅ Disable WebView caching
  incognito={true}           // ✅ Private browsing mode (no cache)
  ...
/>
```

## 🚀 Test Now - Final Attempt!

### 1. Close Payment Sheet
- Tap the **X** button to close current payment sheet

### 2. Close the App Completely
- **Swipe up from bottom** (or double-click home)
- **Swipe up on the app** to kill it completely

### 3. Restart the App
- **Tap the app icon** in simulator to launch fresh

OR

- **Press `i`** in Metro terminal to relaunch

### 4. Test Payment
1. Login as `client@demo.com` / `demo123`
2. Create new booking
3. **Look for the new payment form with:**
   - ✅ Cardholder Name (optional)
   - ✅ Card Number
   - ✅ **Expiration Date** 
   - ✅ **CVV** ← Should appear now!
   - ✅ **Postal Code** ← Should appear now!

### 5. Fill and Submit
- Card: `4111 1111 1111 1111`
- Exp: `12/26`
- CVV: `123`
- ZIP: `12345`
- Click "Pay Now"

## Why This Should Work

With `key={Date.now()}` + `cacheEnabled={false}` + `incognito={true}`, the WebView will:
1. ❌ NOT use cached HTML
2. ✅ Generate fresh HTML from `getDropInHTML()` 
3. ✅ Load new Braintree configuration with CVV and ZIP fields

**Close the payment sheet, kill the app, and restart it fresh!** 🔄
