# Notification System Fix

## Issues Resolved

### 1. Infinite Loop in NotificationContext ✅
**Problem:** Maximum update depth exceeded causing app crashes.

**Root Cause:** The context value object `{ expoPushToken, notification }` was being recreated on every render, causing consumers to re-render infinitely.

**Solution:** Added `useMemo` to memoize the context value:
```tsx
const contextValue = useMemo(
  () => ({ expoPushToken, notification }),
  [expoPushToken, notification]
);
```

### 2. Expo Go Android SDK 53+ Compatibility ✅
**Problem:** `expo-notifications` remote push notifications removed from Expo Go in SDK 53+.

**Error Message:**
```
ERROR expo-notifications: Android Push notifications (remote notifications) 
functionality provided by expo-notifications was removed from Expo Go with 
the release of SDK 53. Use a development build instead.
```

**Solution:** Added detection for Expo Go on Android and skip notification setup:
```tsx
const isExpoGo = Constants.appOwnership === 'expo';
const isAndroid = Platform.OS === 'android';

if (isExpoGo && isAndroid) {
  console.warn('[NotificationContext] Skipping notification setup in Expo Go on Android (SDK 53+)');
  return;
}
```

## Files Modified

1. **`contexts/NotificationContext.tsx`**
   - Added `useMemo` to prevent infinite re-renders
   - Added Expo Go detection to skip notifications on Android
   - Added Platform import

2. **`services/notificationService.ts`**
   - Added Expo Go detection to skip push token registration on Android
   - Added Platform import

## Testing the Fix

### In Expo Go (Current Setup)
- ✅ No more infinite loop crashes
- ✅ App loads successfully
- ⚠️ Push notifications will be skipped on Android (expected behavior)
- ✅ Push notifications still work on iOS in Expo Go

### For Full Notification Support on Android
You need to create a **development build** instead of using Expo Go:

```bash
# Install EAS CLI
npm install -g eas-cli

# Configure EAS
eas build:configure

# Create a development build for Android
eas build --profile development --platform android

# Or create for both platforms
eas build --profile development --platform all
```

After installing the development build APK on your device, notifications will work on Android.

## Notes

- **iOS:** Push notifications continue to work in Expo Go
- **Android:** Requires development build for push notifications (SDK 53+)
- **Web:** Notifications may have limited support
- **Production builds:** Will have full notification support on all platforms

## Current Status

✅ **Infinite loop fixed**  
⚠️ **Android notifications require dev build (as expected in SDK 53+)**  
✅ **iOS notifications working in Expo Go**
