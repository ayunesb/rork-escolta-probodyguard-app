## 📜 Major Work Completed

### Phase 1: Security Audit & Fixes (Completed)
- Fixed XSS vulnerability in webhook endpoint
- Implemented rate limiting
- Added input validation
- Security rules updated

### Phase 2: Payment System Overhaul (Completed)
**Problem**: Drop-in UI was slow, opened in Safari, unprofessional UX

**Solution**: Implemented Braintree Hosted Fields
- Created custom HTML page with Hosted Fields
- Built Cloud Function endpoint to serve page
- Created React Native WebView wrapper component

- `functions/src/index.ts` (added /payments/hosted-fields-page endpoint)
- `components/BraintreeHostedFields.tsx` (163 lines)
- `components/PaymentSheet.tsx` (updated integration)

### Phase 3: Firebase Permissions (Completed)
- Fixed payment creation rules (required clientId field)
- Simplified message rules for chat
- Updated database rules for push tokens
- All rules deployed to production

### Phase 4: Demo User Setup (In Progress)
- ✅ Client account working
- ⏳ Guard accounts need password reset

## 🔑 Demo Account Credentials

| Email | Password | Status |
|-------|----------|--------|
| client@demo.com | `Demo123!` | ✅ Working |
| guard1@demo.com | `Demo123!` | ⚠️ Need reset in Firebase Console |
| guard2@demo.com | `Demo123!` | ⚠️ Need reset in Firebase Console |

**Password Requirements**: 8+ characters, uppercase, special character

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Payment Flow
```
User → PaymentSheet.tsx 
  → BraintreeHostedFields.tsx (WebView)
    → Cloud Function: /payments/hosted-fields-page
      → hostedFieldsPage.html (Braintree Hosted Fields)
        → Braintree Server
          → Payment Success
            → postMessage to React Native
              → paymentService.ts (create Firestore doc)
```

### Authentication Flow
```
User Input → AuthContext.tsx
  → Rate Limit Check (rateLimitService.ts)
    → Firebase Auth (signInWithEmailAndPassword)
      → Success → Load Firestore user doc
        → Navigate to Dashboard
```

## 🐛 Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Login shows auth/invalid-credential
**Causes**:
1. Wrong password (use `Demo123!` not `demo123`)
2. Rate limiting (5 attempts in 15 min = 30 min block)
3. Account doesn't exist

**Solutions**:
1. Wait 30 minutes for rate limit to expire
2. Clear app storage (reinstall app)
3. Verify password in Firebase Console

### Issue: Payment stuck on "Cargando formulario de pago..."
**Status**: ✅ FIXED - Hosted Fields implementation solved this

### Issue: Firestore permission denied
**Status**: ✅ FIXED - Rules updated and deployed

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **IMMEDIATE**: Reset guard passwords in Firebase Console
   - See `QUICK_FIX_GUARDS.md` for step-by-step guide
   
2. **THEN**: Test guard login
   - Run `node verify-all-users.cjs` to confirm
   
3. **AFTER**: Test booking and chat flow
   - Client creates booking
   - Guard accepts
   - Test messaging

4. **FINALLY**: Clean up documentation
   - This file consolidates all previous work
   - Can delete redundant status files
