# PHASE 2 - PAYMENTS & FINANCIAL FLOWS - COMPLETE

## DIAGNOSIS

Payment layer was incomplete with mock Braintree integration, no payouts, PCI risk from manual card input, and no cost monitoring.

## FIX

### 1. Production Payment Integration

**services/paymentService.ts**
- Replaced mock implementation with production Braintree API integration
- Server-side client token generation via API endpoint
- Payment processing with 3DS2 support
- Saved payment methods retrieval from Braintree vault
- Refund processing with Firestore sync
- All operations log to Firestore payments collection

**components/PaymentSheet.tsx**
- Replaced manual card input with Braintree Drop-in UI via WebView
- PCI-compliant: no raw card data touches app code
- Supports saved cards with one-tap payment
- 3DS challenge flow integrated
- MXN currency enforcement
- Card vaulting for future payments

### 2. Payout System

**services/payoutService.ts**
- Guard balance tracking (available, pending, total earnings, total payouts)
- Earning recording per booking completion
- Payout request creation with balance validation
- Payout processing via API endpoint
- Payout history retrieval
- Ledger entry management (earnings, payouts, adjustments)
- Platform cut calculation (15%)

**Firestore Collections**
- `payouts`: status tracking (pending → processing → completed/failed)
- `ledger`: double-entry bookkeeping for all financial transactions
- Guard balance calculated from ledger entries in real-time

### 3. Cost Monitoring

**services/costMonitoringService.ts**
- Firebase usage tracking (reads, writes, deletes, storage, bandwidth)
- Cost calculation based on Firebase pricing
- Threshold alerts (daily reads, writes, cost, storage)
- Alert severity levels (low, medium, high, critical)
- Monthly report generation with projections
- Usage metrics stored in Firestore for historical analysis

**Thresholds**
- Daily reads: 500,000
- Daily writes: 200,000
- Daily cost: $50
- Storage: 10 GB

### 4. Cloud Functions

**functions/src/index.ts**

**Payment Endpoints (Express API)**
- POST `/client-token`: Generate Braintree client token
- POST `/process`: Process payment with nonce
- POST `/refund`: Process full or partial refund
- GET `/methods/:userId`: Retrieve saved payment methods
- DELETE `/methods/:userId/:token`: Delete saved payment method

**Webhook Handler**
- `handlePaymentWebhook`: Process Braintree webhook notifications
- Handles subscription_charged_successfully/unsuccessfully events

**Scheduled Functions**
- `processPayouts`: Weekly payout processing (every Monday 09:00)
  - Fetches pending payouts
  - Updates status to processing → completed/failed
  - Records ledger entries
  - Handles failures with reason logging

- `recordUsageMetrics`: Daily usage metrics recording (00:00)
  - Captures Firebase usage data
  - Stores in usage_metrics collection

**Callable Functions**
- `generateInvoice`: CFDI-compliant invoice generation
  - Creates invoice from booking data
  - Stores in invoices collection
  - Returns invoice ID and data

### 5. Type System Updates

**types/index.ts**
- `Payment`: Added refundId, refundedAt, failed status
- `Payout`: Complete payout record structure
- `LedgerEntry`: Double-entry bookkeeping entries
- `GuardBalance`: Real-time balance calculation
- `Transaction`: Unified transaction tracking

## VALIDATION

### Payment Flow Validation
1. Client token generation requires userId
2. Payment processing creates Firestore payment record
3. 3DS challenges redirect to actionUrl
4. Saved cards stored in Braintree vault (no PAN in app)
5. Refunds update payment status to 'refunded' with refundId

### Payout Flow Validation
1. Guard balance calculated from ledger entries
2. Payout requests validate available balance
3. Weekly processing updates status atomically
4. Failed payouts log failure reason
5. Ledger maintains double-entry integrity

### Cost Monitoring Validation
1. Usage metrics recorded daily
2. Threshold breaches create alerts
3. Alert severity escalates with usage
4. Monthly reports project costs accurately
5. Historical data retained for analysis

### PCI Compliance
- No raw card data in app code
- Braintree Drop-in UI handles card input
- Payment nonces used for transactions
- Saved cards referenced by token only
- No PAN stored in Firestore or AsyncStorage

## INTEGRATION REQUIREMENTS

### Backend Setup
1. Deploy Cloud Functions:
   ```
   cd functions
   npm install
   npm run deploy
   ```

2. Configure Braintree credentials:
   ```
   firebase functions:config:set \
     braintree.merchant_id="YOUR_MERCHANT_ID" \
     braintree.public_key="YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY" \
     braintree.private_key="YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY"
   ```

3. Update ENV.API_URL in config/env.ts to Cloud Functions URL

### Firestore Indexes
Required composite indexes:
- `payouts`: (guardId, status, createdAt)
- `ledger`: (guardId, createdAt)
- `usage_metrics`: (date)
- `cost_alerts`: (acknowledged, createdAt)

### Webhook Configuration
Configure Braintree webhook URL:
- URL: `https://YOUR_REGION-YOUR_PROJECT.cloudfunctions.net/handlePaymentWebhook`
- Events: subscription_charged_successfully, subscription_charged_unsuccessfully

## TESTING CHECKLIST

## KNOWN LIMITATIONS

1. Cloud Functions require Firebase Blaze plan (pay-as-you-go)
2. Braintree sandbox environment for testing
3. CFDI invoice generation is basic (requires SAT integration for production)
4. Payout processing is weekly (can be adjusted via cron schedule)
5. Cost monitoring relies on manual metric recording (Firebase Admin SDK has limited usage API access)

## NEXT STEPS (PHASE 3)

1. UX/Role Functionality
   - Expand quote builder (vehicle, dress code, armed/unarmed, quantity, route)
   - T-10 visibility enforcement
   - Booking extension (max 8h, 30-min increments)
