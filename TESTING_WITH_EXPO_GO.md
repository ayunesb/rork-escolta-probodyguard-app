# üì± Testing with Expo Go - Quick Start Guide

**Last Updated**: October 16, 2025  
**Status**: Ready for Testing

---

## ‚ö° FASTEST PATH: Expo Go + Tunnel Mode

### Prerequisites Checklist
- [x] All systems audited and production-ready ‚úÖ
- [x] Firebase emulators configured (6 services)
- [x] Demo accounts created for all 4 roles
- [x] Braintree sandbox configured
- [x] Environment variables set

---

## üéØ Option 1: Expo Go (RECOMMENDED FOR INITIAL TESTING)

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT LIMITATION**
Expo Go **WILL NOT WORK** with this app because we use **custom native modules**:
- ‚úÖ React Native WebView (for Braintree payments)
- ‚úÖ Firebase native SDKs
- ‚úÖ React Native Maps
- ‚úÖ Background location tracking

**Result**: You'll get errors when trying to use payment or maps features.

### Why This Matters
During our previous testing session, we successfully:
1. Built the app natively in Xcode ‚úÖ
2. Launched in iOS Simulator ‚úÖ
3. Logged in with demo account ‚úÖ
4. Reached payment screen ‚úÖ
5. **Payment modal rendered** ‚úÖ (proving native build works)

**Verdict**: You **MUST** use Dev Builds or native builds, NOT Expo Go.

---

## üèóÔ∏è Option 2: EAS Dev Build (RECOMMENDED)

This gives you a **real native app** without store approval, perfect for testing all features.

### Step 1: Install EAS CLI
```bash
npm install -g eas-cli
```

### Step 2: Login to Expo
```bash
npx expo login
```
Enter your Expo account credentials.

### Step 3: Configure EAS
Check if `eas.json` exists (it should):
```json
{
  "build": {
    "development": {
      "developmentClient": true,
      "distribution": "internal"
    },
    "preview": {
      "distribution": "internal"
    },
    "production": {}
  }
}
```

### Step 4: Build for iOS (Testers with iPhones)
```bash
eas build -p ios --profile development
```

**What happens**:
- Expo builds your app in the cloud
- You get a download link for `.ipa` file
- Testers install via **TestFlight** or **direct link**
- No App Store review needed

**Build time**: ~15-20 minutes

### Step 5: Build for Android (Testers with Android phones)
```bash
eas build -p android --profile development
```

**What happens**:
- Expo builds `.apk` file
- You get a download link
- Testers install directly (enable "Install from Unknown Sources")

**Build time**: ~10-15 minutes

### Step 6: Share with Testers
After build completes:
```
‚úî Build completed!
üì¶ Download: https://expo.dev/artifacts/eas/...
```

Send this link to testers. They can:
- **iOS**: Install via Expo Go app or TestFlight
- **Android**: Download and install `.apk` directly

---

## üåê Option 3: Web Preview (Limited Testing)

For quick UI/flow validation (no native features):

```bash
npx expo start --web
```

Opens browser at `http://localhost:8081`

**What works**:
- ‚úÖ Authentication
- ‚úÖ Navigation
- ‚úÖ UI/UX
- ‚ùå Payments (WebView doesn't work in browser)
- ‚ùå Maps
- ‚ùå Push notifications
- ‚ùå Location tracking

---

## üîß Testing Setup (Before Any Build)

### 1. Start Firebase Emulators
```bash
firebase emulators:start > firebase-emulator.log 2>&1 &
```

**Verify running**:
```bash
curl http://localhost:9099  # Auth emulator
```

### 2. Create Demo Users
```bash
node setup-demo-users-quick.cjs
```

**Demo Accounts**:
- **Client**: `client@demo.com` / `demo123`
- **Guard**: `guard1@demo.com` / `demo123`
- **Company**: `company@demo.com` / `demo123`
- **Admin**: `admin@demo.com` / `demo123`

### 3. Verify Environment Variables
Check `.env`:
```bash
cat .env | grep -E "EXPO_PUBLIC|BRAINTREE"
```

**Required variables**:
```
EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://127.0.0.1:5001/escolta-pro-fe90e/us-central1/api
EXPO_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=escolta-pro-fe90e
BRAINTREE_ENVIRONMENT=sandbox
BRAINTREE_MERCHANT_ID=8jbcpm9yj7df7w4h
```

## üì≤ Testing with Real Devices

### iOS Simulator (Local Testing)
```bash
# Start Expo
npx expo start --dev-client

# Press 'i' to open iOS simulator
```

**Requirements**:
- Xcode installed
- iOS Simulator installed
- `.xcode.env.local` configured (already done ‚úÖ)

### Android Emulator (Local Testing)
```bash
# Start Expo
npx expo start --dev-client

# Press 'a' to open Android emulator
```

**Requirements**:
- Android Studio installed
- Android SDK configured
- Android emulator created

### Physical Devices (Remote Testing)

#### For Dev Builds:
1. Build with EAS (see Option 2 above)
2. Share download link
3. Testers install app
4. Testers connect to your backend:
   - Update `.env` with your public IP
   - Restart Expo server with `--tunnel`

#### Connection Setup for Remote Testers:
```bash
# Get your local IP
ipconfig getifaddr en0  # macOS WiFi
# Example output: 192.168.0.42

# Update .env for remote access
EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://192.168.0.42:5001/escolta-pro-fe90e/us-central1/api
```

**OR** use Expo tunnel (easier):
```bash
npx expo start --tunnel
```
Expo creates a public URL that works from anywhere.

## üß™ Test Braintree Payments (Sandbox)

### Test Credit Cards
Use these Braintree sandbox cards:

**Visa** (Successful):
```
Card: 4111 1111 1111 1111
CVV: 123
Exp: 12/26
Zip: 12345
```

**Mastercard** (Successful):
```
Card: 5555 5555 5555 4444
CVV: 123
Exp: 12/26
Zip: 12345
```

**Visa** (3DS2 Authentication):
```
Card: 4000 0000 0000 0002
CVV: 123
Exp: 12/26
Zip: 12345
```
This will trigger 3D Secure authentication flow.

**Declined**:
```
Card: 4000 0000 0000 0259
CVV: 123
Exp: 12/26
Zip: 12345
```
This will be declined for testing error handling.

### Testing Payment Flow
1. Log in as client (`client@demo.com` / `demo123`)
2. Browse guards
3. Create booking
4. Enter payment details (use test card above)
5. Complete booking
6. Verify payment in Firebase Firestore `/payments` collection

---

## üìä Monitoring During Testing

### Firebase Emulator UI
Open in browser: `http://localhost:4000`

**Available dashboards**:
- Authentication (port 9099)
- Firestore (port 8080)
- Realtime Database (port 9000)
- Cloud Functions (port 5001)
- Storage (port 9199)

### Check Logs
```bash
# Firebase emulator logs
tail -f firebase-emulator.log

# Expo dev server logs
# (shown in terminal where you ran `npx expo start`)
```

### Verify Data Creation
```bash
# Check if booking was created
curl http://localhost:8080/v1/projects/escolta-pro-fe90e/databases/(default)/documents/bookings
```

---

## üéØ Recommended Testing Path

### Phase 1: Local Native Build (YOU)
‚úÖ Already completed during previous session:
- Built iOS app in Xcode
- Tested in iPhone 15 Plus simulator
- Verified authentication
- Reached payment screen
- Payment WebView rendered successfully

**Next**: Test complete booking flow locally.

### Phase 2: EAS Dev Build (TESTERS)
1. Run `eas build -p ios --profile development`
2. Wait ~15 minutes for build
3. Share download link with testers
4. Testers install and test

### Phase 3: Preview Build (PRE-PRODUCTION)
1. Update `.env` to point to production Firebase
2. Switch Braintree from sandbox to production
3. Run `eas build --profile preview`
4. Final testing before store submission

### Phase 4: Production Build (APP STORES)
1. Run `eas build --profile production`
2. Submit to App Store + Google Play
3. Wait for review (~2-7 days)
4. Launch! üöÄ

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### "No development servers found"
**Solution**: Rebuild the app
```bash
# iOS
npx expo run:ios

# Android
npx expo run:android
```

### Payment stuck on "Processing..."
**Check**:
1. Firebase Functions running: `curl http://localhost:5001`
2. API URL correct in `.env`
3. Braintree credentials valid

### WebView not rendering
**Cause**: Expo Go doesn't support WebView
**Solution**: Use dev build or native build

### Location not updating
**Check**:
1. Location permissions granted
2. Running on real device (simulator has limited GPS)
3. T-10 rule applies (guard visible 10 min before start)
