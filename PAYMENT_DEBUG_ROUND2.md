# 🔍 Payment Debugging - Round 2

## What I Just Fixed

### Removed the 30-Second Timeout
- The timeout was just masking the real error
- Now we'll see the actual Braintree error message

### Added Better Error Logging
- Now logging ALL Braintree error details:
  - Error name
  - Error message  
  - Error code
- This will help us see exactly what's wrong

## 🚀 Test Again Now

### Quick Steps:
1. **Press `r`** in Metro terminal to reload the app
2. **Go to payment screen** (create new booking or use existing)
3. **Click "Pay Now"**
4. **Take screenshot** of the error that appears

## 📊 What to Look For

Instead of "timeout after 30 seconds", you should now see a more specific error like:

- "Braintree error: No payment method available"
- "Braintree error: Authorization invalid"
- "Braintree error: Container not found"
- Or some other specific Braintree error

## 🎯 What This Tells Us

The specific error message will reveal:
- If client token is invalid
- If Drop-In container isn't rendering
- If there's a Braintree SDK issue
- If payment methods aren't loading

**Press `r` now and try payment again!** 🚀
