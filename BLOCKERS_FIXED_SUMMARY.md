## 🚀 WHAT'S WORKING NOW

### Webhook Events Now Handled:
1. ✅ Subscription charged successfully → Updates status, logs transactions
2. ✅ Subscription charged unsuccessfully → Sends user notification
3. ✅ Subscription canceled → Updates database
4. ✅ Subscription expired → Sends user notification
5. ✅ Dispute opened → Sends CRITICAL admin alert 🚨
6. ✅ Dispute lost → Updates status, alerts admins
7. ✅ Dispute won → Updates status, alerts admins
8. ✅ Transaction settled → Updates settlement status
9. ✅ Transaction settlement declined → Alerts admins
10. ✅ Disbursement → Tracks payout records
11. ✅ Disbursement exception → Sends CRITICAL admin alert 🚨

### Security Improvements:
- ✅ Private keys only server-side
- ✅ Client bundle clean of credentials
- ✅ Braintree tokenization key properly used (client-safe)

## 📝 NEXT STEPS (Before Production)

### Must Do (Critical):
1. **Test webhooks** with Braintree sandbox
2. **Configure webhook URL** in Braintree Dashboard:  
   `https://us-central1-escolta-pro-fe90e.cloudfunctions.net/api/webhooks/braintree`
3. **Verify Firestore collections** receive updates
4. **Test admin alerts** trigger correctly

### Should Do (High Priority):
5. Run `npm audit` for CVE check
6. Enable Emulator UI (`firebase.json`)
7. Test with Braintree sandbox cards
8. Configure production environment
