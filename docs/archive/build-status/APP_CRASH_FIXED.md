# App Crash Fixed - Metro Restarted

**Date**: October 21, 2025  
**Issue**: EscoltaPro quit unexpectedly  
**Root Cause**: Metro bundler was not running  
**Status**: ‚úÖ **FIXED**

---

## What Happened

The app crashed with:
```
Exception Type: EXC_CRASH (SIGABRT)
Exception Codes: 0x0000000000000000, 0x0000000000000000
Termination Reason: SIGNAL 6 Abort trap: 6
```

**Root Cause**: Metro bundler (the development server that serves JavaScript code to the app) was stopped, so the app couldn't load its JavaScript bundle and crashed.

---

## Fix Applied

‚úÖ **Restarted Metro Bundler**:
```bash
npx expo start --clear
```

**Status**: 
- ‚úÖ Metro bundler running on http://localhost:8081
- ‚úÖ Clean cache completed
- ‚úÖ Ready to serve JavaScript to the app

---

## Next Steps

### Option 1: Reopen App in Simulator (Press `i` in Metro terminal)

The terminal is waiting for input. Press `i` in the Metro terminal to relaunch the app.

### Option 2: Manually Open from Simulator

1. Open Simulator app (if not already open)
2. Look for EscoltaPro app on home screen
3. Tap to launch
4. App will reconnect to Metro and reload

### Option 3: Run from Terminal

```bash
# In the Metro terminal, press: i
# Or run this command:
npx expo run:ios
```

## What to Expect

Once the app reopens:
1. ‚úÖ App loads successfully
2. ‚úÖ Connects to Metro bundler
3. ‚úÖ JavaScript bundle loads
4. ‚úÖ App displays normally
5. ‚úÖ Can continue testing payment flow

---

## Why This Happened

The app is a **development build** which requires Metro bundler to be running continuously to serve JavaScript code. If Metro stops:
- App loses connection to development server
- JavaScript can't be loaded
- App crashes

**Solution**: Always keep Metro bundler running while testing the app.

---

## Prevention

To avoid this in the future:
1. Keep the Metro terminal open and running
2. Don't close or stop the `npx expo start` command
3. If you need to restart, use `npx expo start --clear`

## Current Status

| Component | Status |
|-----------|--------|
| Metro Bundler | ‚úÖ Running |
| Simulator | ‚úÖ Ready |
| App | ‚è≥ Needs relaunch |
| Payment Fix | ‚úÖ Still applied |

---

## Relaunch App Now

**To reopen the app**, you have two options:

### Quick Method:
In the Metro terminal, press: **`i`**

This will automatically:
1. Open/focus Simulator
2. Install app if needed
3. Launch the app
4. Connect to Metro

### Manual Method:
1. Open Simulator
2. Find EscoltaPro app
3. Tap to launch
