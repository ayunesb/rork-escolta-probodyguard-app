- Map frames: 60fps (target)

---

## Known Limitations

### Non-Blocking
1. Cloud Functions dependencies need `npm install`
2. Braintree production credentials needed
3. Production Firebase project needs setup
4. Battery/performance tests need real devices
5. App store assets need preparation

### By Design
1. Web build not supported (mobile-only)
2. Expo Go v53 limitations (no custom native modules)
3. Translation API costs (pay-per-character)
4. Google Maps API costs (pay-per-request)

---

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue:** Cloud Functions not deploying
```bash
# Solution
cd functions
npm install
firebase login
firebase deploy --only functions
```

**Issue:** Payment processing fails
```bash
# Solution
