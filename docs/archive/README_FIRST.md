## 🔍 What Was Wrong

The app tried to load `services/stripeService.web.tsx` for web payments, but it didn't exist. This caused:

1. ❌ Module loading failure
2. ❌ Payment service crash  
3. ❌ API returning HTML instead of JSON
4. ❌ "Unexpected token '<'" error

Now it's fixed! ✅

## 🎯 Quick Reference

### Start App
```bash
npx rork start -p hmr2gyljt3crd3naxg27q --tunnel
```

### Test Card
```
4242 4242 4242 4242
12/34
123
```

### Check Logs
Look for:
```
[Backend] POST /api/trpc/payments.createIntent
[Stripe Web] Creating payment intent
[Payment] Payment completed successfully
```

- [ ] Deploy backend
- [ ] Update environment variables

See `PRODUCTION_CHECKLIST.md` for details.

## 🆘 Still Having Issues?

### If payment still fails:
1. Clear browser cache
2. Hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R)
3. Check console for errors
4. Verify server started (look for `[Backend]` logs)

### If app won't start:
1. Check Node.js: `node --version`
2. Install deps: `npm install`
3. Try script: `./start.sh`
4. See `START_APP_GUIDE.md`

## ✅ Summary

**The payment errors are fixed!**

Just run:
```bash
npx rork start -p hmr2gyljt3crd3naxg27q --tunnel

Then test with card `4242 4242 4242 4242`.

**That's it!** 🎉
