[2025-10-06 21:14:00] Firebase Realtime Database Rules Deployed
  ✅ database.rules.json deployed successfully
  ✅ Rules syntax validated

[2025-10-06 21:14:30] Cloud Functions Deployment Attempted
  ❌ Build failed: package.json/package-lock.json out of sync
  ❌ Missing dependencies: react@19.2.0, @tanstack/react-query@5.90.2, etc.

  ❌ Same error: package-lock.json out of sync
  
[2025-10-06 21:17:00] Removed package-lock.json and reinstalled

[2025-10-06 21:35:23] Cloud Functions Deployment Retry #2
  ❌ Same error persists
  ⚠️  Root cause identified: functions/package.json has wrong dependencies

CURRENT STATUS

✅ DEPLOYED:
  - Firestore Security Rules
  - Realtime Database Security Rules
  - Storage Security Rules (assumed deployed)
  - Firestore Indexes

❌ PENDING DEPLOYMENT:

CRITICAL FIX REQUIRED
---------------------

File: functions/package.json
Issue: Contains React Native and Expo dependencies that shouldn't be in Cloud Functions
Impact: Cloud Functions deployment fails

Required Dependencies (Backend Only):
  - braintree@^3.33.1
  - cors@^2.8.5
  - express@^4.21.2
  - firebase-admin@^12.7.0

Remove These Dependencies:
  - @trpc/react-query
  - expo (all expo-* packages)
  - react-native (all react-native-* packages)
  - react
  - react-dom

FIX STEPS:
1. Edit functions/package.json manually
2. Remove all React Native/Expo dependencies
3. Keep only backend dependencies (listed above)
4. cd functions && rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
5. npm install
6. cd .. && firebase deploy --only functions
