## 📊 Monitoring Services Overview

### 1. Sentry Error Tracking (`services/sentryService.ts`)

**Purpose**: Comprehensive error tracking and crash reporting
**Integration**: React Native app with error boundaries and performance measurement

**Key Features**:
- Automatic crash detection and reporting
- Performance transaction tracking
- Custom error reporting with context
- User session tracking
- Release and environment tracking

**Usage Example**:
```typescript
import { sentryService } from '@/services/sentryService';

// Initialize in app startup
await sentryService.initSentry();

// Track errors
sentryService.reportError(error, { context: 'payment_processing' });

// Measure performance
const transaction = sentryService.measurePerformance('booking_flow');
transaction.finish();
```

### 2. Firebase Analytics (`services/analyticsService.ts`)

**Purpose**: Enhanced user behavior tracking and business metrics
**Integration**: Firebase Analytics with comprehensive event tracking

**Key Events Tracked**:
- User authentication (signup, login, logout)
- Booking lifecycle (started, completed, cancelled)
- Payment processing (initiated, completed, failed)
- Security events (emergency, location sharing)
- Performance issues and API errors
- User engagement metrics

**Usage Example**:
```typescript
import { analyticsService } from '@/services/analyticsService';

// Track booking completion
await analyticsService.trackBookingCompleted(
  'booking_123',
  'Personal Protection',
  4,
  1000
);

// Track payment events
await analyticsService.trackPaymentCompleted(
  'txn_456',
  1000,
  'MXN',
  'credit_card'
);
```

### 3. Performance Monitoring (`services/performanceService.ts`)

**Purpose**: Firebase Performance monitoring with custom metrics
**Integration**: Real-time performance measurement and optimization

**Key Metrics**:
- Screen load times
- API call performance
- Payment processing duration
- Custom business logic performance
- Network request monitoring

**Usage Example**:
```typescript
import { performanceService } from '@/services/performanceService';

// Measure screen load
const trace = await performanceService.measureScreenLoad('BookingScreen');
trace.stop();

// Measure API calls
const apiTrace = await performanceService.measureApiCall('/api/bookings');
apiTrace.stop();
```

### 4. App Check Security (`services/appCheckService.ts`)

**Purpose**: Advanced security layer with platform-specific providers
**Integration**: Firebase App Check with Play Integrity (Android), App Attest (iOS), and reCAPTCHA (Web)

**Security Features**:
- Platform attestation verification
- API request authentication
- Token-based security headers
- Debug token support for development

**Usage Example**:
```typescript
import { appCheckService } from '@/services/appCheckService';

// Initialize security
await appCheckService.initialize();

// Secure API calls
const secureResponse = await appCheckService.secureApiCall('/api/sensitive-data');
```

### 5. Content Security Policy (`backend/middleware/security.ts`)

**Purpose**: Web security headers and CORS configuration
**Integration**: Express.js middleware for comprehensive security

**Security Headers**:
- Content Security Policy with payment provider allowlists
- XSS Protection and MIME type security
- Frame options and referrer policy
- Strict Transport Security (HTTPS)
- Rate limiting for API protection

**Usage Example**:
```typescript
import { securityHeadersMiddleware, paymentCSPMiddleware } from '@/backend/middleware/security';

// Apply to all routes
app.use(securityHeadersMiddleware);

// Special CSP for payment pages
app.use('/payment', paymentCSPMiddleware);
```
