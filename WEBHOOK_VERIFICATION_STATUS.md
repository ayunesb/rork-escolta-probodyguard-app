## üéØ Next Steps: Real Payment Testing

Now that we've confirmed the system is working with the "check" webhook, let's test with real payment events from your mobile app.

### Quick Test Plan:

1. **Open the Rork app** on iPhone 15 Plus simulator (already running)
2. **Login** with test account
3. **Make a test payment** to trigger a real webhook
4. **Verify** new webhook appears in Firestore

---

## üì± Testing Instructions

### Step 1: Start Log Monitoring

Open a **new terminal window** and run:
```bash
cd /Users/abrahamyunes/blindado/rork-escolta-probodyguard-app
firebase functions:log --only api -f
```

This will show real-time webhook activity.

### Step 2: Make Test Payment in App

**In the iPhone simulator:**
1. Navigate to subscription/payment section
2. Use test card:
   ```
   Card Number: 4111 1111 1111 1111
   Expiry: 12/25
   CVV: 123
   ZIP: 12345
   ```
3. Complete payment

### Step 3: Watch for New Webhook

**In Firestore** (your current browser tab):
- Click refresh icon or press F5
- Look for NEW document (not the "check" one)
- Should see:
  ```
  kind: "subscription_charged_successfully" 
  (or "transaction_settled")
  verified: true
  timestamp: (just now)
  ```

**In terminal logs**, look for:
```
[Webhook] Received request
[Webhook] Signature verified successfully
[Webhook] Parsed notification: subscription_charged_successfully
Processing subscription webhook...
Updated subscription: xxx
```
