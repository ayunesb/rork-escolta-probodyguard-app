# 🎯 BRAINTREE FIXES - VISUAL SUMMARY

## Before Documentation Review
```
❌ Mixed module systems (require + import)
❌ Hardcoded sandbox environment
❌ Excessive mock fallbacks
❌ Generic error messages
❌ No 3D Secure support
❌ No device data collection
⚠️  Webhook (had signature, needed more events)
```

## After All Fixes Applied
```
✅ ES6 imports throughout (Firebase v2 compliant)
✅ Dynamic environment switching (sandbox ↔ production)
✅ Clean token generation
✅ Structured error codes (PAYMENT_CONFIG_ERROR, etc.)
✅ 3D Secure enabled (SCA compliant)
✅ Device data collection (fraud prevention)
✅ Enhanced webhook events (disputes, chargebacks, etc.)
✅ TypeScript builds successfully
```
