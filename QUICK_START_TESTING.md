# üì± QUICK START - Mobile Webhook Testing

## ‚úÖ You're Ready! App is running on iPhone 15 Plus

### Current Status:
- ‚úÖ Expo running with tunnel
- ‚úÖ App opened on iPhone 15 Plus simulator
- ‚úÖ Webhook handlers deployed
- ‚úÖ Firebase Functions active

---

## üéØ Quick Test Steps

### 1. Start Webhook Log Monitoring (New Terminal)

Open a new terminal and run:
```bash
cd /Users/abrahamyunes/blindado/rork-escolta-probodyguard-app
firebase functions:log --only api -f
```

Keep this running - you'll see webhooks arrive in real-time!

### 2. Open Firestore Console

Open in browser:
```
https://console.firebase.google.com/project/escolta-pro-fe90e/firestore/databases/-default-/data/~2Fwebhook_logs
```

Keep this tab open - refresh to see new webhook logs appear.

### 3. Test in the App

**In the iPhone simulator:**

1. **Login** to the app with your test account
2. **Navigate to payment/subscription section**
3. **Make a test payment** with:
   ```
   Card: 4111 1111 1111 1111
   Expiry: 12/25
   CVV: 123
   ZIP: 12345
   ```

### 4. Watch for Webhooks

**What to look for:**

**Terminal logs** should show:
```
[Webhook] Received request
[Webhook] Signature verified successfully
[Webhook] Parsed notification: subscription_charged_successfully
Processing subscription webhook...
```

**Firestore** should show new document in `webhook_logs`:
```
kind: "subscription_charged_successfully"
verified: true
timestamp: (just now)
```
