    checkout: braintreeCheckoutProcedure,
    refund: braintreeRefundProcedure,
  }),
}),
```
**Status:** ✅ Clean router with only Braintree routes

### Fee Structure
```
Subtotal (hourly rate × hours)
+ Vehicle Fee (25% if armored)
+ Protection Fee (15% if armed)
+ Platform Fee (10% of subtotal + fees)
= Total Amount (MXN)
```

### Payout Distribution
- **Platform Fee:** 15% of total
- **Guard Payout:** 70% of total

2. ⚠️ **Switch to Production Braintree:**
   ```env
   BRAINTREE_ENV=production
   BRAINTREE_MERCHANT_ID=your_production_merchant_id
   BRAINTREE_PUBLIC_KEY=your_production_public_key
   BRAINTREE_PRIVATE_KEY=your_production_private_key
   ```
3. ⚠️ **Install Native Drop-in UI:** For production native apps, install `react-native-braintree-dropin-ui`
4. ✅ **Test with real cards:** Use small amounts first
5. ✅ **Monitor Braintree Dashboard:** Watch for successful transactions
6. ✅ **Set up webhooks:** For payment confirmations and disputes

## 🔧 Known Issues & Limitations

### ⚠️ Native Drop-in UI
**Issue:** Native Braintree Drop-in UI requires a native module not available in Expo Go  
**Impact:** Native apps use mock nonce generation  
**Solution:** For production, install `react-native-braintree-dropin-ui`  
**Workaround:** Web implementation is fully functional

### ⚠️ Package.json
**Issue:** Stripe packages still listed in package.json  
**Impact:** Packages are installed but not used  
**Solution:** Run `bun remove @stripe/react-stripe-js @stripe/stripe-js @stripe/stripe-react-native`  
**Status:** Cannot be automated via tools
