# üöÄ MANUAL DEPLOYMENT GUIDE - Step by Step

This guide will walk you through deploying the Cloud Functions manually. Follow each step carefully.

---

## üìã WHAT YOU NEED BEFORE STARTING

1. **A computer** with internet connection
2. **Terminal/Command Prompt** access (we'll show you how to open it)
3. **Your Firebase project** (escolta-pro-fe90e)
4. **Braintree credentials** (already in Rork environment variables)

---

## üñ•Ô∏è STEP 1: OPEN TERMINAL/COMMAND PROMPT

### On Mac:
1. Press `Command + Space` to open Spotlight
2. Type "Terminal"
3. Press Enter

### On Windows:
1. Press `Windows Key + R`
2. Type "cmd"
3. Press Enter

### On Linux:
1. Press `Ctrl + Alt + T`

---

## üìÇ STEP 2: NAVIGATE TO YOUR PROJECT

In the terminal, type these commands one by one (press Enter after each):

```bash
cd /path/to/your/project
```

**Replace `/path/to/your/project`** with the actual location of your project folder.

**Example:**
- Mac: `cd /Users/yourname/Documents/escolta-pro`
- Windows: `cd C:\Users\yourname\Documents\escolta-pro`

To verify you're in the right place, type:
```bash
ls
```
(or `dir` on Windows)

You should see folders like: `app`, `functions`, `assets`, etc.

---

## üîß STEP 3: INSTALL FIREBASE CLI

This is a one-time installation. In your terminal, type:

```bash
npm install -g firebase-tools
```

Wait for it to finish (may take 2-5 minutes).

---

## üîê STEP 4: LOGIN TO FIREBASE

Type this command:

```bash
firebase login
```

This will:
1. Open your web browser
2. Ask you to sign in with your Google account
3. Ask for permissions - click "Allow"
4. Show "Success!" message

Go back to your terminal - you should see "‚úî Success! Logged in as your-email@example.com"

---

## üì¶ STEP 5: NAVIGATE TO FUNCTIONS FOLDER

Type:

```bash
cd functions
```

---

## üìù STEP 6: CREATE PACKAGE.JSON

Type this command:

```bash
npm init -y
```

You should see a message like "Wrote to /path/to/functions/package.json"

---

## üì• STEP 7: INSTALL DEPENDENCIES

Copy and paste this ENTIRE command (it's long):

```bash
npm install firebase-admin@^12.0.0 firebase-functions@^4.5.0 express@^4.18.2 cors@^2.8.5 braintree@^3.19.0
```

Press Enter and wait (may take 3-5 minutes).

Then install development dependencies:

```bash
npm install --save-dev @types/express@^4.17.21 @types/cors@^2.8.17 typescript@^5.3.3
```

---

## üî® STEP 8: BUILD THE FUNCTIONS

Type:

```bash
npm run build
```

If you see an error "npm run build not found", first run:

```bash
npx tsc
```

---

## üåê STEP 9: INITIALIZE FIREBASE PROJECT

Go back to the root folder:

```bash
cd ..
```

Now initialize Firebase:

```bash
firebase init
```

You'll see a menu. Use arrow keys to navigate:

1. **Select features:** Use spacebar to select:
   - ‚úÖ Firestore
   - ‚úÖ Functions
   - ‚úÖ Hosting (optional)
   
   Press Enter when done.

2. **Use existing project:** Select "Use an existing project"

3. **Select project:** Choose "escolta-pro-fe90e"

4. **Firestore rules:** Press Enter (use default)

5. **Firestore indexes:** Press Enter (use default)

6. **Functions language:** Select "TypeScript"

7. **Use ESLint:** Type "N" and press Enter

8. **Install dependencies:** Type "N" (we already did this)

9. **Public directory:** Press Enter (use default "public")

10. **Single-page app:** Type "Y" and press Enter

---

## üîë STEP 10: SET BRAINTREE CREDENTIALS

The Braintree credentials are already in Rork's environment. We need to set them in Firebase:

```bash
firebase functions:config:set braintree.merchant_id="8jbcpm9yj7df7w4h"
```

```bash
firebase functions:config:set braintree.public_key="fnig6rkd6vbkmxt"
```

```bash
firebase functions:config:set braintree.private_key="c96f93d2d472395ed66339"
```

After each command, you should see "‚úî Functions config updated."

---

## üöÄ STEP 11: DEPLOY FUNCTIONS

Now for the big moment! Type:

```bash
firebase deploy --only functions
```

This will:
1. Upload your functions to Firebase
2. Take 3-10 minutes
3. Show progress bars

**What you'll see:**
```
‚úî functions: Finished running predeploy script.
i  functions: ensuring required API cloudfunctions.googleapis.com is enabled...
i  functions: ensuring required API cloudbuild.googleapis.com is enabled...
‚úî functions: required API cloudfunctions.googleapis.com is enabled
‚úî functions: required API cloudbuild.googleapis.com is enabled
i  functions: preparing functions directory for uploading...
i  functions: packaged functions (XX.XX KB) for uploading
‚úî functions: functions folder uploaded successfully
i  functions: creating Node.js 18 function api...
i  functions: creating Node.js 18 function handlePaymentWebhook...
i  functions: creating Node.js 18 function processPayouts...
i  functions: creating Node.js 18 function generateInvoice...
i  functions: creating Node.js 18 function recordUsageMetrics...
‚úî functions[api]: Successful create operation.
‚úî functions[handlePaymentWebhook]: Successful create operation.
‚úî functions[processPayouts]: Successful create operation.
‚úî functions[generateInvoice]: Successful create operation.
‚úî functions[recordUsageMetrics]: Successful create operation.

‚úî Deploy complete!
```

---

## üìù STEP 12: GET YOUR FUNCTION URLS

After deployment, you'll see URLs like:

```
Function URL (api): https://us-central1-escolta-pro-fe90e.cloudfunctions.net/api
```

**COPY THIS URL!** You'll need it for the next step.

If you missed it, type:

```bash
firebase functions:list
```

---

## üîó STEP 13: UPDATE YOUR APP WITH THE FUNCTION URL

1. Open your project in your code editor
2. Find the file: `config/env.ts`
3. Look for the line with `API_URL`
4. Replace it with your function URL from Step 12

**Example:**
```typescript
API_URL: "https://us-central1-escolta-pro-fe90e.cloudfunctions.net/api"
```

5. Save the file

---

## ‚úÖ STEP 14: VERIFY DEPLOYMENT

Test if your functions are working:

```bash
curl https://YOUR-FUNCTION-URL/health
```

Replace `YOUR-FUNCTION-URL` with the URL from Step 12.

Or visit the URL in your web browser.

---

## üéâ SUCCESS!

Your Cloud Functions are now deployed! Here's what you deployed:

‚úÖ **Payment API** - Handles Braintree payments
‚úÖ **Webhook Handler** - Receives payment notifications
‚úÖ **Payout Processor** - Runs every Monday at 9 AM
‚úÖ **Invoice Generator** - Creates invoices for bookings
‚úÖ **Usage Metrics** - Records daily usage

---

## üÜò TROUBLESHOOTING

### Error: "Firebase CLI not found"
**Solution:** Run `npm install -g firebase-tools` again

### Error: "Permission denied"
**Solution:** 
- Mac/Linux: Add `sudo` before the command: `sudo npm install -g firebase-tools`
- Windows: Run Command Prompt as Administrator

### Error: "Project not found"
**Solution:** Make sure you're logged in: `firebase login`

### Error: "Build failed"
**Solution:** 
1. Delete `node_modules` folder in functions directory
2. Run `npm install` again
3. Run `npm run build` again

### Error: "Insufficient permissions"
**Solution:** 
1. Go to Firebase Console: https://console.firebase.google.com
2. Select your project: escolta-pro-fe90e
3. Go to Settings ‚Üí Users and permissions
4. Make sure your account has "Owner" or "Editor" role

### Functions deployed but not working
**Solution:**
1. Check logs: `firebase functions:log`
2. Make sure Braintree credentials are set correctly
3. Verify the function URL is correct in your app

---

## üìû NEED HELP?

If you get stuck:

1. **Check the logs:**
   ```bash
   firebase functions:log
   ```

2. **Check Firebase Console:**
   - Go to: https://console.firebase.google.com
   - Select: escolta-pro-fe90e
   - Click: Functions (in left menu)
   - You should see your 5 functions listed

3. **Test individual function:**
   ```bash
   firebase functions:shell
   ```

---

## üîÑ UPDATING FUNCTIONS LATER

If you need to update the functions in the future:

1. Make your code changes
2. Navigate to functions folder: `cd functions`
3. Build: `npm run build`
4. Deploy: `firebase deploy --only functions`

---

## üìä MONITORING YOUR FUNCTIONS

To see how your functions are performing:

1. Go to: https://console.firebase.google.com
2. Select: escolta-pro-fe90e
3. Click: Functions
4. Click on any function name to see:
   - Invocations (how many times it ran)
   - Execution time
   - Memory usage
   - Errors

---

## üí∞ COST MONITORING

Firebase Functions have a free tier:
- 2 million invocations/month
- 400,000 GB-seconds/month
- 200,000 CPU-seconds/month

To monitor costs:
1. Go to: https://console.firebase.google.com
2. Select: escolta-pro-fe90e
3. Click: Usage and billing (in left menu)

---

## üéØ NEXT STEPS

After deployment:

1. ‚úÖ Update `config/env.ts` with your function URL
2. ‚úÖ Test payment flow in your app
3. ‚úÖ Set up Braintree webhook URL in Braintree dashboard
4. ‚úÖ Test refund functionality
5. ‚úÖ Verify scheduled functions are running

---

**That's it! You've successfully deployed your Cloud Functions! üéä**
