## 🎯 Choose Your Testing Method

### Option 1: iOS Simulator (FASTEST - Local Only) ⚡

**Best for**: Quick testing on YOUR machine only

```bash
# Start Expo dev server
npx expo start --dev-client

# Press 'i' to launch iOS Simulator
# Or scan QR with iPhone (physical device)
```

**Time to test**: ~30 seconds  
**Features**: ALL features work (payments, maps, location)  
**Devices**: Only devices on your WiFi network (192.168.0.42)

---

### Option 2: EAS Dev Build (RECOMMENDED for Testers) 🏗️

**Best for**: Sharing with friends/testers anywhere in the world

#### Step 1: Build for iOS
```bash
eas build -p ios --profile development
```

**What happens**:
- ⏱️ Build time: ~15-20 minutes
- 📦 You get a download link
- 📱 Testers install on iPhone (no App Store)
- ✅ All native features work

#### Step 2: Build for Android
```bash
eas build -p android --profile development
```

**What happens**:
- ⏱️ Build time: ~10-15 minutes
- 📦 You get `.apk` download link
- 📱 Testers install directly on Android
- ✅ All native features work

#### Step 3: Share with Testers
After build completes, you'll see:
```
✅ Build complete!
📦 Download: https://expo.dev/artifacts/eas/xyz123...
```

**Send this link** + test credentials to testers.

---

### Option 3: Expo Tunnel (⚠️ LIMITED - Expo Go) 

**⚠️ WARNING**: Payments and maps **WILL NOT WORK** in Expo Go

```bash
npx expo start --tunnel
```

**What works**:
- ✅ Authentication
- ✅ Navigation/UI
- ❌ Payments (WebView not supported)
- ❌ Maps
- ❌ Background location

**Only use this** for UI/UX feedback, NOT full feature testing.

## 📲 RECOMMENDED: Start with iOS Simulator

Let's test locally first to ensure everything works:

### 1. Start Expo Dev Server
```bash
npx expo start --dev-client
```

### 2. Open iOS Simulator
Press **`i`** in the terminal, or:
```bash
# Manually open simulator
open -a Simulator
```

### 3. Test the Flow

**Login as Client**:
```
Email: client@demo.com
Password: demo123
```

**Test Steps**:
1. ✅ Browse available guards
2. ✅ Create a booking
3. ✅ Enter payment details:
   - Card: `4111 1111 1111 1111`
   - CVV: `123`
   - Exp: `12/26`
   - Zip: `12345`
4. ✅ Complete booking
5. ✅ View booking details
6. ✅ Test chat with guard

**Login as Guard**:
```
Email: guard1@demo.com
Password: demo123
```

**Test Steps**:
1. ✅ View pending bookings
2. ✅ Accept booking
3. ✅ Enter start code (shown in client's booking details)
4. ✅ Start service
5. ✅ Test chat with client

## 🌍 For Remote Testers (Different WiFi/Location)

If testers are NOT on your WiFi network, you need **EAS Dev Build**:

### Quick Commands
```bash
# iOS (for testers with iPhones)
eas build -p ios --profile development

# Android (for testers with Android)
eas build -p android --profile development
```

**Build will take ~15-20 minutes**. You'll get a download link to share.

**Alternative**: Use Expo tunnel (but payments won't work):
```bash
npx expo start --tunnel
```

---

## 🧪 Test Credit Cards (Braintree Sandbox)

### ✅ Successful Payment
```
Card Number: 4111 1111 1111 1111
CVV: 123

### 🔒 3D Secure Test
```
Card Number: 4000 0000 0000 0002

## 📊 Monitoring During Tests

### Firebase Emulator UI
Open in browser:
```
http://localhost:4000
```

**Available**:
- 👤 Authentication (view users)
- 🗄️ Firestore (view bookings, payments, messages)
- 📡 Realtime Database (view guard locations)
- ⚡ Cloud Functions (view logs)
- 📦 Storage (view uploaded files)

### Check Logs
```bash
# Firebase emulator logs
tail -f firebase-emulator.log

# Expo dev server logs
# (shown in terminal where expo is running)
```

### Verify Payment Processed
```bash
# Check Firestore for payments
curl "http://localhost:8080/v1/projects/escolta-pro-fe90e/databases/(default)/documents/payments" | jq
```

---

## 🐛 Quick Troubleshooting

### "Cannot connect to dev server"
**iOS Simulator**:
```bash
# Make sure .xcode.env.local exists
cat .xcode.env.local
# Should show: EXPO_DEV_SERVER_URL=http://192.168.0.42:8081

# Rebuild the app
npx expo run:ios
```

### "Payment stuck on Processing..."
**Check**:
```bash
# 1. Functions running?
curl http://localhost:5001

# 2. Check .env API URL
cat .env | grep EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL
# Should be: http://127.0.0.1:5001/escolta-pro-fe90e/us-central1/api
```

### "WebView not rendering"
**Cause**: Using Expo Go (doesn't support WebView)  
**Solution**: Use dev build or run `npx expo run:ios`

### "No guards available"
**Cause**: Guard needs to be marked as available  
**Solution**: 
1. Login as guard
2. Go to profile
3. Toggle "Available for bookings"

## 🎯 Next Steps After Local Testing

### 1. ✅ Verify Locally First
Test complete flow in iOS Simulator (YOU):
- [ ] Client can create booking

- [ ] Guard receives notification
- [ ] Guard can accept booking
- [ ] Chat works both ways
- [ ] Start code verification works
- [ ] Location tracking works
- [ ] Service can be completed
- [ ] Rating can be submitted

### 2. 🏗️ Build for External Testers
Once local testing passes:
```bash
# Build for iOS testers
eas build -p ios --profile development

# Build for Android testers  
eas build -p android --profile development
```

### 3. 📤 Share with Testers
Send them:
- 📦 Download link (from EAS build output)
- 🔐 Test credentials (client@demo.com / demo123)
- 💳 Test card (4111 1111 1111 1111)
- 📋 Testing checklist

### 4. 📊 Collect Feedback
Monitor:
- Firebase Emulator UI for data
- Console logs for errors
- Tester feedback on flows

### 5. 🚀 Prepare for Production
When ready:
- Update `.env` to production Firebase
- Switch Braintree to production
- Run `eas build --profile production`
- Submit to App Store + Google Play
