# Company and Admin Login Fix

## Issues Identified

1. ❌ **Sign-up page only showed Client and Guard roles** - Company and Admin options were missing
2. ❌ **Sign-in page didn't show demo credentials for Company and Admin**
3. ❌ **No routing logic for Company and Admin roles** - All users were routed to the same home screen
4. ❌ **Demo accounts for Company and Admin don't exist in Firebase**

## Fixes Applied

### 1. ✅ Updated Sign-Up Page (`app/auth/sign-up.tsx`)
- Added Company and Admin role buttons
- Now all 4 roles are available during sign-up:
  - Client
  - Guard
  - Company
  - Admin

### 2. ✅ Updated Sign-In Page (`app/auth/sign-in.tsx`)
- Updated demo account information to show all roles:
  ```
  Client: client@demo.com | Guard: guard1@demo.com
  Company: company@demo.com | Admin: admin@demo.com
  Password: demo123 (for all accounts)
  ```

### 3. ✅ Updated Routing Logic (`app/index.tsx`)
- Added role-based routing with console logs
- Currently all roles route to `/(tabs)/home` but with proper logging
- Ready for future implementation of role-specific dashboards

### 4. ✅ Created Documentation (`DEMO_ACCOUNTS.md`)
- Comprehensive guide on how to create missing demo accounts
- Instructions for testing each role
- Troubleshooting section

## How to Test

### Step 1: Create Demo Accounts

The **company@demo.com** and **admin@demo.com** accounts need to be created manually. You have two options:

#### Option A: Using the App (Easiest)
1. Open the app
2. Go to Sign Up
3. Select "Company" role
4. Fill in:
   - Email: `company@demo.com`
   - Password: `demo123`
   - First Name: `Demo`
   - Last Name: `Company`
   - Phone: `+1-555-0100`
5. Click "Create Account"
6. Repeat for Admin role with `admin@demo.com`

#### Option B: Using Firebase Console
1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Select project: `escolta-pro-fe90e`
3. Create users in Authentication
4. Create corresponding documents in Firestore `users` collection

### Step 2: Test Login

1. **Test Company Login:**
   ```
   Email: company@demo.com
   Password: demo123
   ```
   - Should successfully log in
   - Console should show: `[Index] Company role detected - routing to home (company dashboard not yet implemented)`
   - Currently routes to home screen (same as client/guard)

2. **Test Admin Login:**
   ```
   Email: admin@demo.com
   Password: demo123
   ```
   - Should successfully log in
   - Console should show: `[Index] Admin role detected - routing to home (admin dashboard not yet implemented)`
   - Currently routes to home screen (same as client/guard)

## What Still Needs to Be Done

### Phase 1: Create Role-Specific Pages

1. **Company Dashboard** (`app/(tabs)/company-home.tsx` or similar)
   - Guard management interface
   - Company bookings overview
   - Guard performance metrics
   - Add/remove guards

2. **Admin Dashboard** (`app/(tabs)/admin-home.tsx` or similar)
   - User management (all roles)
   - System settings
   - Booking oversight
   - KYC approval interface
   - Analytics and reports

### Phase 2: Update Routing

Update `app/index.tsx` to route to role-specific pages:
```typescript
case 'company':
  router.replace('/(tabs)/company-home');
  break;
case 'admin':
  router.replace('/(tabs)/admin-home');
  break;
```

### Phase 3: Update Tab Navigation

Update `app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx` to show role-appropriate tabs:
- **Client**: Home, Bookings, Profile
- **Guard**: Home, Bookings, Profile
- **Company**: Dashboard, Guards, Bookings, Profile
- **Admin**: Dashboard, Users, Bookings, Settings

### Phase 4: Implement Role-Specific Features

**Company Features:**
- View and manage guards
- Assign guards to bookings
- View company earnings
- Manage guard schedules
- Review guard performance

**Admin Features:**
- Approve/reject KYC documents
- Manage all users (CRUD operations)
- View all bookings
- Handle disputes
- System configuration
- Analytics dashboard

## Current Status

✅ **Working:**
- Sign-up with all 4 roles
- Sign-in with proper credentials
- Role detection and logging
- Demo account documentation

⚠️ **Partially Working:**
- Company and Admin can log in but see the same interface as Client/Guard
- No role-specific features yet

❌ **Not Working:**
- Company-specific dashboard
- Admin-specific dashboard
- Role-based tab navigation
- Company and Admin demo accounts don't exist yet (need to be created manually)

## Error Messages and Solutions

### "Invalid email address"
**Cause:** Email format is incorrect or has extra spaces  
**Solution:** Make sure email is lowercase and properly formatted

### "No account found with this email"
**Cause:** The demo account hasn't been created yet  
**Solution:** Create the account using the sign-up page or Firebase Console

### "User document not found"
**Cause:** Firebase Auth user exists but Firestore document is missing  
**Solution:** Create the user document in Firestore with proper role and fields

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate:** Create company@demo.com and admin@demo.com accounts using the sign-up page
2. **Short-term:** Implement company and admin dashboard pages
3. **Medium-term:** Add role-based tab navigation
4. **Long-term:** Implement all role-specific features

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Create company@demo.com account
- [ ] Create admin@demo.com account
- [ ] Test company login - should succeed
- [ ] Test admin login - should succeed
- [ ] Verify console logs show correct role detection
- [ ] Verify no errors in console during login
- [ ] Test that existing client and guard logins still work
