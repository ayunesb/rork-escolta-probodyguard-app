# PHASE 1 SECURITY & INFRASTRUCTURE - COMPLETE

## IMPLEMENTATION STATUS

### 1. Firestore Security Rules
**Status:** DEPLOYED
**Location:** firestore.rules

Rules enforce:
- Role-based access control (client/guard/company/admin)
- Booking-scoped data access
- KYC document protection
- Payment record isolation
- Emergency alert access control
- Audit log protection

**Validation Required:**
Deploy to Firebase Console via:
```bash
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules
```

### 2. Rate Limiting Integration
**Status:** COMPLETE

**Integrated Services:**
- AuthContext: Login rate limiting (5 attempts/15min, 30min block)
- bookingService: Booking creation (10/hour, 1hr block)
- bookingService: Start code verification (3 attempts/5min, 15min block)
- chatService: Message sending (30/minute, 5min block)

**Implementation Details:**
- Local AsyncStorage tracking with Firestore violation logging
- Automatic reset on successful operations
- User-friendly error messages with time remaining
- Violation logs stored in rateLimitViolations collection

### 3. Security Enforcement Points

**Login Flow:**
- Rate limit check before Firebase Auth call
- Reset on successful authentication
- Block duration: 30 minutes after 5 failed attempts

**Booking Creation:**
- Rate limit per clientId
- 10 bookings per hour maximum
- 1 hour block on violation

**Start Code Verification:**
- Rate limit per booking + user combination
- 3 attempts per 5 minutes
- 15 minute block on violation
- Automatic reset on correct code

**Chat Messages:**
- Rate limit per booking + sender combination
- 30 messages per minute
- 5 minute block on violation

## VALIDATION CHECKLIST

### Firestore Rules Deployment
- [ ] Deploy rules to Firebase Console
- [ ] Test unauthorized cross-role access (guard reading another guard's booking)
- [ ] Test unauthorized document access (client reading another client's KYC)
- [ ] Verify admin full access
- [ ] Verify company roster isolation

### Rate Limiting Tests
- [ ] Login: Trigger 5 failed attempts, verify 30min block
- [ ] Booking: Create 10 bookings in 1 hour, verify block
- [ ] Start Code: Enter 3 wrong codes, verify 15min block
- [ ] Chat: Send 30 messages in 1 minute, verify 5min block
- [ ] Verify violation logs in Firestore rateLimitViolations collection

### Integration Tests
- [ ] Successful login resets rate limit
- [ ] Correct start code resets rate limit
- [ ] Rate limit errors display time remaining
- [ ] AsyncStorage persists rate limit state across app restarts

## NEXT STEPS - PHASE 2: PAYMENTS

**Priority Tasks:**
1. Replace mock payment service with production provider (Braintree/Adyen)
2. Implement PCI-compliant card vaulting
3. Add payout service for guard payments
4. Create webhook handlers for payment events
5. Implement CFDI-compliant invoice generation (MXN)
6. Add cost monitoring and Firebase usage alerts

**Files to Modify:**
- services/paymentService.ts (full replacement)
- components/PaymentSheet.tsx (integrate provider Drop-in UI)
- Create: services/payoutService.ts
- Create: services/costMonitoringService.ts
- Create: Cloud Functions for webhooks and payouts

## SECURITY SCORE UPDATE

**Phase 1 Completion:**
- Security & Privacy: 15/20 (RLS deployed, rate limits active, KYC audit pending)
- Reliability: 10/15 (rate limiting adds resilience)
- Total: 25/100

**Remaining Critical Items:**
- KYC audit trail implementation
- GDPR deletion API
- Firebase App Check deployment
- Payment security (Phase 2)
