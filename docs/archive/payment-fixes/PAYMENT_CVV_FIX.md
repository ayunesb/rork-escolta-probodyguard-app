# 🔧 Payment CVV Field Fix

## ❌ Problem Found

The Braintree Drop-In form was **missing the CVV field**! 

This is why `requestPaymentMethod()` was hanging - Braintree requires the CVV field for security, and without it, it won't return a payment nonce.

## ✅ What I Fixed

Added explicit field configuration to the Braintree Drop-In:

```javascript
card: {
  cardholderName: {
    required: false  // Optional
  },
  cvv: {
    required: true   // ✅ ADDED THIS!
  },
  expirationDate: {
    required: true   // ✅ ADDED THIS!
  }
}
```

## 🚀 Test Now

1. **Press `r`** in Metro terminal to reload the app
2. **Go to payment screen** (create new booking)
3. **You should now see**:
   - ✅ Cardholder Name field (optional)
   - ✅ Card Number field
   - ✅ Expiration Date field
   - ✅ **CVV field** (NEW!)
   - ✅ Postal Code field (if shown)

4. **Fill in the test card**:
   - Card: `4111 1111 1111 1111`
   - Exp: `12/26`
   - **CVV: `123`** ← This field should now appear!
   - Name: `Test User` (optional)

5. **Click "Pay Now"**

## 🎯 Expected Result

With the CVV field present, Braintree should now:
1. ✅ Validate all required fields
2. ✅ Call `requestPaymentMethod()` callback
3. ✅ Return a payment nonce
4. ✅ Process the payment successfully
5. ✅ Navigate to booking details screen

**Press `r` to reload and test the payment again!** 🚀

The CVV field should now appear in the form!
