## 🎯 WHAT YOU'RE DEPLOYING

You're deploying 5 Cloud Functions to Firebase:

1. **Payment API** (`api`)
   - Handles payment processing
   - Generates client tokens
   - Processes refunds
   - Manages saved cards

2. **Webhook Handler** (`handlePaymentWebhook`)
   - Receives notifications from Braintree
   - Updates payment status

3. **Payout Processor** (`processPayouts`)
   - Runs every Monday at 9 AM
   - Processes guard payouts

4. **Invoice Generator** (`generateInvoice`)
   - Creates invoices for bookings
   - Called from your app

5. **Usage Metrics** (`recordUsageMetrics`)
   - Runs daily at midnight
   - Records Firebase usage

## 📋 PREREQUISITES

Before you start, make sure you have:

- [ ] A computer (Mac, Windows, or Linux)
- [ ] Internet connection
- [ ] Terminal/Command Prompt access
- [ ] Your project files downloaded
- [ ] Firebase project: `escolta-pro-fe90e`
- [ ] Braintree credentials (already configured in Rork)

---

## ⏱️ TIME ESTIMATE

**First-time deployment:** 25-30 minutes
- Installing tools: 5-10 minutes
- Installing dependencies: 5 minutes
- Building and deploying: 10-15 minutes

**Future updates:** 5 minutes
- Just build and deploy

---

## 🎓 SKILL LEVEL

**No coding experience needed!**

This guide is written for non-technical users. You just need to:
- Copy and paste commands
- Follow instructions carefully
- Read error messages if they appear

---

## 💰 COST

**Free tier includes:**
- 2 million function calls/month
- 400,000 GB-seconds/month
- 200,000 CPU-seconds/month

**You'll likely stay within the free tier** unless you have very high traffic.

To monitor costs:
1. Go to: https://console.firebase.google.com
2. Select: `escolta-pro-fe90e`
3. Click: Usage and billing

---

## 🔐 SECURITY

**Your credentials are safe:**
- Braintree credentials are stored securely in Firebase
- Never committed to code
- Only accessible by your Cloud Functions
- Encrypted in transit and at rest

**The credentials you'll use:**
- Merchant ID: `8jbcpm9yj7df7w4h`
- Public Key: `fnig6rkd6vbkmxt`
- Private Key: `c96f93d2d472395ed66339`

These are **sandbox credentials** for testing. You'll need production credentials before launching.
