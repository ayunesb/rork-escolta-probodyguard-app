# üîç Added Critical Test - WebView Communication Check

**Status**: Test message added to verify WebView bridge ‚úÖ

---

## üéØ WHAT I ADDED:

Added a **test message** that will be sent immediately when the WebView loads:

```javascript
if (window.ReactNativeWebView) {
  window.ReactNativeWebView.postMessage(JSON.stringify({
    type: 'test_message',
    message: 'WebView JavaScript is running!'
  }));
} else {
  alert('ReactNativeWebView not found!');
}
```

This will tell us if the WebView bridge is working!

---

## ‚úÖ EXPECTED OUTCOMES:

### Scenario A: Bridge Works (Good!)
**You'll see in logs**:
```
[PaymentSheet] ‚úÖ TEST MESSAGE RECEIVED: WebView JavaScript is running!
```
**Means**: WebView can communicate with React Native - the issue is elsewhere

### Scenario B: Bridge Doesn't Work (The Problem!)
**You'll see**:
- An alert popup saying "ReactNativeWebView not found!"
- OR nothing in logs

**Means**: The WebView bridge isn't set up correctly - need to fix WebView import

---

## üöÄ TEST NOW:

### 1. Reload the App
Press `r` in Metro terminal

### 2. Go to Payment
- Login
- Create booking  
- Click "Proceed to Payment"

### 3. Watch for Two Things:

**A. Alert Popup**:
- If you see "ReactNativeWebView not found!" = Bridge broken

**B. Logs**:
- If you see `‚úÖ TEST MESSAGE RECEIVED` = Bridge works!

---

## üìù WHAT THIS TELLS US:

If the test message works, then the payment button click SHOULD also work, which means the issue is likely in:
1. **Braintree initialization** - taking too long or failing silently
2. **Form validation** - Braintree requiring something we're not providing
3. **Payment nonce generation** - failing before it can send message

If the test message DOESN'T work, then we need to:
1. Fix the WebView import
2. Enable the bridge properly

---

**RELOAD NOW AND LET'S SEE!** üéØ

Press `r` then try payment again!
