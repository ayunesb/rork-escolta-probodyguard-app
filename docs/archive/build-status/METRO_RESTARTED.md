# 🚀 Metro Restarted - Ready to Test Updated Payment Code

## ✅ What Just Happened

Metro bundler stopped earlier, so the app was still running the **old code** with the 30-second timeout.

I've now:
1. ✅ **Restarted Metro** on port 8081 with `--clear` flag
2. ✅ **All changes are saved** in PaymentSheet.tsx:
   - ❌ Removed 30-second timeout (confusing error)
   - ✅ Added CVV field configuration (`cvv: { required: true }`)
   - ✅ Added postal code field (`postalCode: { required: true }`)
   - ✅ Added expiration date field (`expirationDate: { required: true }`)
   - ✅ Better Braintree error logging

## 🎯 Next Steps

### 1. Reload the App
**Press `r`** in Metro terminal OR in the simulator:
- Shake the device (Simulator menu → Device → Shake)
- Press reload button

### 2. Test Payment Again
1. **Login** as `client@demo.com` / `demo123`
2. **Create new booking**
3. **Go to payment screen**
4. **You should now see ALL fields**:
   - Cardholder Name (optional)
   - Card Number
   - **Expiration Date** ✅
   - **CVV** ✅ NEW!
   - **Postal Code** ✅ NEW!

5. **Fill in**:
   - Card: `4111 1111 1111 1111`
   - Exp: `12/26`
   - CVV: `123`
   - ZIP: `12345`
   - Name: `Test User` (optional)

6. **Click "Pay Now"**

## 📊 What to Watch For

If the payment still hangs, look in Metro terminal for new error messages like:
- `[WebView] Dropin creation error: ...`
- `[PaymentSheet] Payment error from WebView: Braintree error: ...`

These will tell us the **exact** Braintree issue instead of the generic timeout.
