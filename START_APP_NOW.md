## 🔧 If App Won't Start

The issue is that `bunx` command is not available. I've fixed the start script to use `npx` instead.

**Try these in order:**

1. **Use npm directly**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

2. **Use the fixed start script**:
   ```bash
   chmod +x start.sh
   ./start.sh
   ```

3. **Use npx directly**:
   ```bash
   npx rork start -p hmr2gyljt3crd3naxg27q --tunnel
   ```

## 📱 Testing the Payment Flow

1. **Sign In**: Use demo credentials or create account
2. **Browse Guards**: Go to Home tab
3. **Book a Guard**: Select guard → Fill details → Continue
4. **Payment**: 
   - Amount will show in MXN
   - Enter test card: 4111 1111 1111 1111
   - CVV: 123, Expiry: 12/25
   - Click "Pay"
5. **Success**: You'll see booking confirmation with start code

## 📊 What Happens When You Pay

1. **Frontend**: Braintree Hosted Fields tokenize card → get nonce
2. **Backend**: Process payment with Braintree gateway
3. **Vault**: Card saved for future one-tap payments (if customerId provided)
4. **Firebase**: Payment record created with:
   - Transaction ID
   - Amount in MXN
   - Platform fee (15%)
   - Guard payout (70%)
   - Company payout (15%)
5. **Booking**: Status updated to confirmed
6. **Notification**: User receives confirmation

## 🎯 Next Steps After Testing

1. **Production Mode**:
   - Update `.env` with production Braintree credentials
   - Change `BRAINTREE_ENV=production`
   - Test with real cards

2. **Native Drop-in** (for production mobile):
   ```bash
   npm install react-native-braintree-dropin-ui
   ```
   Then update `BraintreePaymentForm.native.tsx` to use real Drop-in

3. **Deploy**: Your app is ready for production!

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### "bunx: command not found"
✅ **FIXED**: Start script now uses `npx` first

### "API endpoint returned HTML"
- Make sure you started with `npm start` (not just `expo start`)
- The API routes need the Rork server

### "Failed to get client token"
- Check `.env` has Braintree credentials
- Verify backend is running
- Check console for detailed error

### Payment fails
- Use test card: 4111 1111 1111 1111
- Check Braintree sandbox dashboard
- Review backend logs
