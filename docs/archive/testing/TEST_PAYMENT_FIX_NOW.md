# üöÄ Quick Test: Payment Form Fix

**Status**: Fix applied, Metro restarting  
**Time Required**: 5 minutes  
**Test Account**: client@demo.com / Demo1234!

---

## What We Fixed

**Problem**: Payment form hung on "Cargando formulario de pago..."  
**Cause**: App tried to fetch saved cards for non-existent Braintree customer (404 error)  
**Solution**: Handle 404 gracefully, return empty array, let form load normally

## Test Now (5 Steps)

### 1. Wait for Metro (30 seconds)

Metro bundler is restarting with clean cache. Watch terminal for:
```
‚Ä∫ Metro waiting on exp://...

```

### 2. Reload App in Simulator

**If app already open**:
- Press `Cmd+D` in simulator

**If app closed**:
```bash
open -a Simulator
# Then launch Escolta Pro from home screen
```

### 3. Test Payment Flow

2. **Navigate**: "Buscar Guardias" ‚Üí Select any guard
3. **Book**: Create booking (any date/time)

5. **Watch**: Payment form should load immediately (no hanging!)

### 4. Expected Console Output

Open terminal running Metro, watch for:
```
[Payment] Requesting client token...

[Payment] No saved cards found (first-time user)  ‚Üê NEW MESSAGE
```
