# Login Error Fixes - Summary

## 🎯 What Was Fixed

### 1. **Firestore Permission Errors** ✅
- **Problem**: Users couldn't create their own documents after authentication
- **Solution**: Updated Firestore rules to properly validate user document creation
- **File**: `firestore.rules` (line 37-38)

### 2. **Auth Context Retry Logic** ✅
- **Problem**: Single permission failures caused complete login failure
- **Solution**: Added 3-retry mechanism with exponential backoff
- **File**: `contexts/AuthContext.tsx` (lines 56-117)

### 3. **Image URI Warnings** ✅
- **Problem**: Empty strings passed to Image components
- **Solution**: Enhanced SafeImage component with better validation
- **File**: `components/SafeImage.tsx` (lines 10-24)

## 🚀 Quick Deploy

Run this command to deploy the fixes:

```bash
chmod +x deploy-fixes.sh
./deploy-fixes.sh
```

Or manually:

```bash
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules
```

## 🧪 Testing

After deploying, test with these accounts:

| Role | Email | Password |
|------|-------|----------|
| Client | client@demo.com | demo123 |
| Guard | guard1@demo.com | demo123 |
| Company | company@demo.com | demo123 |
| Admin | admin@demo.com | demo123 |

## 📊 Expected Behavior

### Before Fix:
- ❌ Login stuck on loading screen
- ❌ Console errors: "Permission denied"
- ❌ Console errors: "ensureUserDocument failed"
- ❌ Console warnings: "source.uri should not be an empty string"

### After Fix:
- ✅ Login completes within 5 seconds
- ✅ User document created automatically
- ✅ Retry logic handles temporary failures
- ✅ No image URI warnings

## 🔍 Monitoring

Check these logs after deploying:

```
[Auth] State changed: <userId>
[Auth] User document loaded successfully
```

Or if creating new user:
```
[Auth] User document not found. Creating...
[Auth] Created minimal user document
```

## ⚠️ If Issues Persist

1. **Clear app cache**: 
   - iOS: Delete app and reinstall
   - Android: Clear app data
   - Web: Clear browser cache (Cmd+Shift+R)

2. **Verify Firestore rules deployed**:
   - Go to Firebase Console
   - Navigate to Firestore Database > Rules
   - Check that rules were updated recently

3. **Check environment variables**:
   - Ensure `.env` file has `EXPO_PUBLIC_ALLOW_UNVERIFIED_LOGIN=1`
   - Verify Firebase config values are correct

4. **Check Firebase Authentication**:
   - Ensure Email/Password provider is enabled
   - Verify demo accounts exist in Authentication tab
