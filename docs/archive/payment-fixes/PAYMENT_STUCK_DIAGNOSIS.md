# 🔍 Payment Processing Issue - Diagnosis

**Problem**: Payment sheet stays open, doesn't navigate to next screen after payment

## 📊 What's Happening (Based on Logs):

```
✅ Payment sheet loads successfully
✅ Client token received from Braintree
✅ Booking created: booking_1760650581709
❌ Payment processing stuck - no navigation
```

## 🎯 ROOT CAUSE:

Looking at the logs, I see:
1. `[Payment] Client token received` ✅
2. `[Payment] Error loading saved cards` ⚠️ (non-critical)
3. **No log showing "Payment successful" or "Payment failed"**

This means the payment WebView is loaded, but when you click "Pay", **nothing happens**.

## 🔧 LIKELY ISSUES:

### Issue #1: Firebase Functions Emulator Not Responding
The payment API endpoint `/payments/process` needs to be called, but:
- Functions emulator might not be running
- API URL might be incorrect

### Issue #2: WebView Not Sending Payment Nonce
The Braintree Drop-In UI in WebView needs to:
1. Collect card info
2. Get payment nonce from Braintree
3. Send nonce back to React Native via `postMessage`
4. React Native calls API to process payment

**One of these steps is failing silently.**

## ✅ QUICK FIX OPTIONS:

### Option 1: Check Firebase Emulators (FIRST)

Run this to see if Functions emulator is running:
```bash
lsof -i :5001
```

If nothing shows up, restart emulators:
```bash
npx firebase emulators:start
```

### Option 2: Add Debug Logging

I can add console logs to the PaymentSheet WebView to see exactly what's happening when you click "Pay".

### Option 3: Simplify Payment Flow

Instead of using Braintree Drop-In WebView, we can use a simpler direct nonce approach for testing.

## 🎯 RECOMMENDED NEXT STEP:

Let me add debug logging to the PaymentSheet to see what's happening when you submit payment. This will tell us:
- Is the form being submitted?
- Is a nonce being generated?
- Is the API being called?
- What's the response?

**Would you like me to add debug logging and rebuild?**

Or, if Firebase Functions aren't running, we need to start them first.

## 📝 Alternative: Mock Payment for Testing

If you just want to test the booking flow without actual payment processing, I can:
1. Add a "Skip Payment (Test Mode)" button
2. Directly mark booking as confirmed
3. Navigate to booking details

This would let you test the rest of the app while we debug payments separately.

**What would you prefer?**
