   ↓
3. User enters card details
   → BraintreePaymentForm validates input
   ↓
4. Frontend sends payment request
   → POST /api/trpc/payments.braintree.checkout
   → Backend processes with Braintree

✅ **Encrypted transmission** - HTTPS required for all API calls  
✅ **Private keys** - Never exposed to client  
✅ **Audit logging** - All transactions logged with timestamps
