## üöÄ BUILDING FOR DEVELOPMENT

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have:
- [x] EAS CLI installed: `npm install -g eas-cli`
- [x] Expo account created
- [x] Logged in to EAS: `eas login`

### Step 1: Configure EAS Project

```bash
# Initialize EAS project (if not already done)
eas build:configure

# This will:
# - Create eas.json (already exists ‚úÖ)
# - Link to your Expo project
# - Set up build profiles
```

### Step 2: Build for Android (Development)

```bash
# Build APK for testing
eas build --profile development --platform android

# Follow the prompts:
# 1. Generate new Android keystore? YES
# 2. Wait for build (10-15 minutes)
# 3. Download APK when complete
```

**Why development build?**
- Push notifications work (not in Expo Go SDK 53+)
- Background location tracking works
- Full native module support
- Closer to production environment

### Step 3: Build for iOS (Development)

```bash
# Build for iOS
eas build --profile development --platform ios

# You'll need:
# - Apple Developer account ($99/year)
# - UDID of test device
# - Ad Hoc provisioning profile
```

**Get your device UDID**:
```bash
# Connect iPhone and run:
eas device:create

# Or get from Finder (macOS):
# 1. Connect iPhone
# 2. Open Finder
# 3. Click on iPhone
# 4. Click on device info to see UDID
```

### Step 4: Install and Test

**Android**:
```bash
# Download APK from EAS build page
# Transfer to Android device
# Install: Settings ‚Üí Security ‚Üí Unknown sources ‚Üí Install
```

**iOS**:
```bash
# Download IPA from EAS build page
# Install via Apple Configurator or TestFlight
```

## üß™ TESTING CHECKLIST

Once development build is installed:

### Authentication Flow
- [ ] Sign up with new email
- [ ] Receive verification email
- [ ] Verify email and login
- [ ] Test session persistence (close/reopen app)
- [ ] Test logout

### Guard Features (Critical!)
- [ ] Login as guard (guard1@demo.com)
- [ ] Start location tracking
- [ ] **Background tracking**: Put app in background, verify location updates
- [ ] Accept booking
- [ ] Navigate during active booking
- [ ] Complete booking

### Client Features
- [ ] Login as client
- [ ] Search for guards
- [ ] View guard location (during T-10 window)
- [ ] Create booking
- [ ] Make payment (sandbox card: 4111 1111 1111 1111)
- [ ] Track guard in real-time

### Notifications (Development Build Only!)
- [ ] Receive push notification permission prompt
- [ ] Grant permission
- [ ] Receive booking notification
- [ ] Receive chat message notification
- [ ] Receive payment confirmation

### Location Tracking
- [ ] Foreground tracking works
- [ ] **Background tracking works** (CRITICAL TEST!)
- [ ] Location appears on client map
- [ ] Updates every 5-10 seconds
- [ ] Stops when booking completed

---

## üìä EXPECTED BEHAVIOR

### Background Location (Guards)

**Correct Behavior**:
```
1. Guard accepts booking
2. Location tracking starts
3. Put app in background
4. Location continues updating every 10 seconds
5. Notification shows: "Tracking location for active booking"
6. Client sees guard moving in real-time
7. Stop tracking when booking completes
```

**If Not Working**:
- Check: Background Location permission granted ("Always Allow")
- Check: Notification shows tracking is active
- Check: Firebase Realtime Database updates (Console)
- Check: Phone power saving mode disabled

### Push Notifications

**Correct Behavior**:
```
1. App requests permission on first launch
2. Permission granted
3. Token saved to Firestore
4. Notifications arrive even when app backgrounded
5. Tapping notification opens relevant screen
```

**If Not Working**:
- ‚ùå Using Expo Go? ‚Üí Must use development build!
- Check: Notification permission granted in Settings
- Check: FCM token in Firestore users collection
- Check: Cloud Function logs for send attempts

## üîß TROUBLESHOOTING

### Build Failed

**Error: "Gradle build failed"**
```bash
# Solution: Clear build cache
eas build --profile development --platform android --clear-cache
```

**Error: "No matching provisioning profile" (iOS)**
```bash
# Solution: Clear credentials
eas credentials
# Select iOS ‚Üí Select profile ‚Üí Remove all ‚Üí Rebuild
```

### Runtime Errors

**Error: "TaskManager not found"**
```bash
# You're probably in Expo Go - use development build!
eas build --profile development --platform android
```

**Error: "Location permission denied"**
```bash
# Solution: Grant permission in device settings
# Android: Settings ‚Üí Apps ‚Üí Escolta Pro ‚Üí Permissions ‚Üí Location ‚Üí Always Allow
# iOS: Settings ‚Üí Privacy ‚Üí Location ‚Üí Escolta Pro ‚Üí Always
```

## üéØ NEXT STEPS AFTER TESTING

### If All Tests Pass ‚úÖ

1. **Create Preview Build** (for stakeholder testing)
   ```bash
   eas build --profile preview --platform all
   ```

2. **Set Up TestFlight** (iOS) / **Internal Testing** (Android)
   ```bash
   # iOS
   eas submit --platform ios --profile preview
   
   # Android
   eas submit --platform android --profile preview
   ```

3. **Gather Feedback**
   - Share build with team
   - Test on multiple devices
   - Document any issues

### If Tests Fail ‚ùå

1. **Check Logs**
   ```bash
   # View device logs
   npx react-native log-android  # Android
   npx react-native log-ios      # iOS
   ```

2. **Review Audit Report**
   - See `NASA_GRADE_AUDIT_REPORT.md`
   - Check specific subsystem sections
   - Follow fix instructions

3. **Run Local Tests**
   ```bash
   ./run-tests.sh
   ```
