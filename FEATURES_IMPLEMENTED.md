## Technical Implementation Details

### Real-Time Architecture
```typescript
// Subscription pattern
const unsubscribe = bookingService.subscribeToGuardBookings(guardId, (bookings) => {
  // Handle real-time updates
  setPendingBookings(bookings.filter(b => b.status === 'pending'));
});

// Cleanup on unmount
return () => unsubscribe();
```

### Notification Flow
```
1. User logs in → Register push token
2. Booking created → Sync to Firebase → Trigger notification
3. Guard accepts → Update Firebase → Notify client
4. User taps notification → Deep link to booking details
```

### Data Sync Strategy
- **Local First**: AsyncStorage for offline support
- **Real-Time Sync**: Firebase Realtime Database for instant updates
- **Graceful Degradation**: App works offline, syncs when online
