## 🚀 How to Start Testing

### Option 1: Quick Browser Test

Test the payment form directly in your browser:

```bash
# Get a client token
curl http://127.0.0.1:5001/escolta-pro-fe90e/us-central1/api/payments/client-token | jq -r '.clientToken'

# Open payment form (replace TOKEN with actual token)
open "http://127.0.0.1:5001/escolta-pro-fe90e/us-central1/api/payments/hosted-form?clientToken=TOKEN&amount=100"
```

**Test Card:**
- Card: `4111 1111 1111 1111`
- Expiry: `12/25`
- CVV: `123`
- Zip: `12345`

### Option 2: Full App Testing

```bash
# Start the app
bun run start

# Then:
# 1. Scan QR code with Expo Go (mobile)
# 2. Or press 'w' for web browser
# 3. Navigate to a guard profile
# 4. Create a booking
# 5. Proceed to payment
# 6. Test with card above
```
