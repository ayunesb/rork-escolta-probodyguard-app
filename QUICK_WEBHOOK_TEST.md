## 🚀 Quick Test Steps (5 minutes)

### Step 1: Open Braintree Dashboard
```
https://sandbox.braintreegateway.com
```

### Step 2: Navigate to Webhooks
1. Click **Settings** (gear icon)
2. Click **Webhooks**
3. Find your webhook: `https://us-central1-escolta-pro-fe90e.cloudfunctions.net/api/webhooks/braintree`

### Step 3: Send Test Webhook
1. Click on your webhook URL
2. Scroll down to find **"Test Notification"** or **"Send Test"** button
3. Select event: **`subscription_charged_successfully`**
4. Click **"Send Test Notification"**

### Step 4: Verify Webhook Received

**Option A: Check Firestore** (Easiest)
1. Open: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/escolta-pro-fe90e/firestore/databases/-default-/data/~2Fwebhook_logs
2. Click refresh (F5)
3. Look for NEW document with:
   ```
   kind: "subscription_charged_successfully"
   verified: true
   timestamp: (just now)
   ```

**Option B: Check Logs**
```bash
firebase functions:log --only api | grep -i webhook | tail -20
```

Expected output:
```
[Webhook] Received request
[Webhook] Signature verified successfully ✅
[Webhook] Parsed notification: subscription_charged_successfully
Processing subscription webhook...
```

## 📊 Test Multiple Events

Try these in order:

### Test 1: ✅ Subscription Success
- Event: `subscription_charged_successfully`
- Expected: New webhook_logs entry + subscription created/updated

### Test 2: ❌ Payment Failed
- Event: `subscription_charged_unsuccessfully`  
- Expected: Webhook logged + user notification created

### Test 3: 🚨 Dispute Opened
- Event: `dispute_opened`
- Expected: Webhook logged + dispute record + **ADMIN ALERT**

### Test 4: 💰 Disbursement
- Event: `disbursement`
- Expected: Webhook logged + payout record created

---

## ✅ Success Criteria

Each test PASSES if you see:
1. ✅ New document in `webhook_logs` collection
2. ✅ `verified: true` in the document
3. ✅ Correct `kind` field matches event type
4. ✅ Recent timestamp (within seconds)
5. ✅ Related collection updated (subscriptions, disputes, payouts, notifications)

---

## 🎉 Why This Method is Better

- ✅ No app/payment form issues
- ✅ Instant webhook delivery
- ✅ Can test all 11 event types quickly
- ✅ Repeatable and reliable
- ✅ See results in real-time in Firestore

## 📱 App Payment Testing (Optional - Later)

Once webhooks are verified working via dashboard, you can fix the app payment form issue separately. The important thing is confirming webhooks work end-to-end.
