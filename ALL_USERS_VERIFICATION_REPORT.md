## Root Cause Analysis

### What We Discovered

1. **client@demo.com** was updated to use `Demo123!` (strong password)
2. **guard1@demo.com** and **guard2@demo.com** exist in Firebase Auth but have different passwords
3. They were likely created with `demo123` originally and never updated

### Why This Happened

When password requirements were updated to require:
- Minimum 8 characters
- Uppercase letter
- Special character

The client account was updated to `Demo123!`, but guard accounts were not.

## How to Fix

### Option 1: Firebase Console (Recommended) 🌐

**Quick Steps:**
1. Go to: https://console.firebase.google.com/
2. Select project: **escolta-pro-fe90e**
3. Click **Authentication** → **Users**
4. Find `guard1@demo.com`:
   - Click the three dots (⋮)
   - Select **Reset password**
   - Set password to: `Demo123!`
5. Repeat for `guard2@demo.com`
6. Run verification: `node verify-all-users.cjs`

**Time**: ~2 minutes

### Option 2: Delete and Recreate 🗑️

**If you can't reset passwords:**
1. Go to Firebase Console → Authentication → Users
2. Find `guard1@demo.com` and `guard2@demo.com`
3. Delete both users
4. Run: `node reset-guard-passwords.cjs`
5. Script will create them with correct password

**Time**: ~3 minutes

### Option 3: Update Password Requirements 🔓

**If you want to keep old password:**
1. Update guards to use `demo123` instead
2. Update DEMO_USERS in `verify-all-users.cjs`
3. Update documentation

**Not recommended** - weak password doesn't meet security requirements

## After Fix - Testing Checklist

Once passwords are reset, verify all accounts:

```bash
node verify-all-users.cjs
```

Expected output:
```
Total: 3/3 users working correctly
```

Then test in the app:

### 1. Test Client Login ✅ (Already Works)
- Open app
- Login: `client@demo.com` / `Demo123!`
- Should work immediately

### 2. Test Guard 1 Login
- Open app (or different device/simulator)
- Login: `guard1@demo.com` / `Demo123!`
- Should see guard dashboard

### 3. Test Guard 2 Login
- Open app (or different device/simulator)  
- Login: `guard2@demo.com` / `Demo123!`
- Should see guard dashboard

### 4. Test Chat/Messaging
- Login as client, create booking
- Login as guard, accept booking
- Try sending messages from both sides
- Verify messages appear in real-time
