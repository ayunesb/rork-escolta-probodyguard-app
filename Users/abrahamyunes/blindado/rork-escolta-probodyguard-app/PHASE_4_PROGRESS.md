## Technical Implementation Details

### Route Service Architecture

```typescript
// Core Functions
calculateRoute(options) -> RouteInfo
  - Google Maps Directions API
  - Polyline decoding
  - Traffic data integration
  - Fallback calculations

calculateDistance(point1, point2) -> number
  - Haversine formula
  - Earth radius: 6371 km
  - Accurate for all distances

estimateETA(distance, speed?) -> Date
  - Average speed: 40 km/h
  - Traffic multiplier: 1.3x
  - Real-time speed override

checkRouteDeviation(location, polyline) -> RouteDeviation
  - Point-to-segment distance
  - Threshold: 500m default
  - Reroute suggestions
```

### Geofencing Architecture

```typescript
// Geofencing Service
class GeofencingService {
  - startMonitoring() // Location watching
  - addGeofence(geofence, callback)
  - checkGeofences(location) // Distance checks
  - triggerGeofenceEvent(event)
  - sendNotification(title, body)
}

// Proximity Alert Service
class ProximityAlertService {
  - addProximityAlert(id, location, thresholds, callback)
  - checkProximity(location) // Check all alerts
  - resetAlert(id) // Reset triggered thresholds
}

// Helper Functions
setupBookingGeofences(bookingId, pickup, destination, callbacks)
cleanupBookingGeofences(bookingId)
```

### Integration Points

1. **LocationTrackingContext**
   - Manages geofencing lifecycle
   - Monitors proximity alerts
   - Updates UI state (isNearPickup, isNearDestination)

2. **Tracking Screen**
   - Displays route polyline
   - Shows ETA and distance
   - Renders proximity alerts
   - Updates in real-time

3. **MapView Component**
   - Renders polylines
   - Supports multiple markers
   - Customizable colors
   - Follows user location

## Performance Optimizations

### Route Calculation
- Debounced updates (only on significant location changes)
- Cached routes for 30 seconds
- Fallback to straight-line distance
- Async/await for non-blocking

### Geofencing
- Efficient distance calculations
- Threshold-based triggering
- Cleanup on unmount
- Battery-optimized intervals (5s)

### Map Rendering
- Polyline simplification for performance
- Marker clustering (future)
- Region-based updates
- Lazy loading

## Known Issues & Limitations

### Route Service
1. Google Maps API key required for production
2. Polyline decoding assumes Google format
3. Traffic data requires premium API tier
4. Web fallback uses straight-line distance

### Geofencing
1. Web platform has limited support (console only)
2. Background location requires special permissions
3. Battery drain with continuous monitoring
4. Notification permissions required
