## What to Watch For

### Console Logs
Monitor these log prefixes:
- `[Payment]` - Payment flow progress
- `[Stripe Web]` or `[Stripe]` - Stripe integration
- `[tRPC Client]` - API communication
- `[Backend]` - Server responses

### Expected Flow
```
[Payment] Starting payment process
[Payment] Using payment method: new
[Payment] Processing new payment method
[Stripe Web] Creating payment intent
[tRPC Client] Request to: http://localhost:8081/api/trpc
[Backend] POST /api/trpc/payments.createIntent
[Stripe Web] Payment intent created successfully
[Payment] Payment intent created: pi_xxx
[Stripe Web] Confirming payment
[Payment] Payment completed successfully
```

### Success Indicators
‚úÖ No HTML/JSON parse errors  
‚úÖ Payment intent created with ID starting with `pi_`  
‚úÖ Booking confirmation alert appears  
‚úÖ Redirected to active booking screen  

### Error Indicators
‚ùå "Unexpected token '<'" error = tRPC connection issue  
‚ùå "Invalid API key" = Stripe configuration problem  
‚ùå "Payment failed" = Card declined or processing error  

---

## Troubleshooting

### Error: "Unexpected token '<', "<!DOCTYPE "... is not valid JSON"

**Cause:** tRPC endpoint returning HTML instead of JSON

**Solutions:**
1. Verify backend is running
2. Check console for `[Backend]` logs
3. Test health endpoint: `http://localhost:8081/api/health`
4. Restart development server

### Error: "Invalid API Key"

**Cause:** Stripe keys not loaded

**Solutions:**
1. Check `.env` file has Stripe keys
2. Restart development server
3. Verify keys in Stripe dashboard

### Payment Succeeds but No Booking

**Cause:** Post-payment logic failure

**Solutions:**
1. Check Firebase permissions
2. Verify user authentication
3. Check console for errors after payment

---

## Verify in Stripe Dashboard

1. Go to [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/)
2. Navigate to **Payments** section
3. Look for recent payment intents
4. Verify amount matches booking cost
5. Check payment status (succeeded/failed)
