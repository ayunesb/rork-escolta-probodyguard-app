## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Webhook Returns 403
**Problem**: Invalid signature  
**Solution**: Verify Braintree credentials in Cloud Functions

### Webhook Returns 500
**Problem**: Internal error  
**Solution**: Check logs: `firebase functions:log --only api`

### No Data in Firestore
**Problem**: Handler failed  
**Solution**: 
1. Check `webhook_logs` - Is webhook being received?
2. Check `unhandled_webhooks` - Unknown event type?
3. Check Functions logs for errors

### No Admin Alerts
**Problem**: No admin users found  
**Solution**: Create user with `role: "admin"` in Firestore
